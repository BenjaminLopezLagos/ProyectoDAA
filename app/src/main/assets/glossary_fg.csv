?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Hover Dash,"A forward dash that doesn't move your character along the ground, but rather sends them into the air at a sharp angle. It's also commonly called a ""Morrigan Dash"" after the Darkstalkers character who often uses this style of approach. Hover dashes are scary, because they can grant very fast air actions without needing to jump, which tends to lead to scary overhead mixups. The downside, though, is that it can be more difficult for these characters to cover horizontal distance if they want to get closer. Every time they dash forward, they have to go into the air."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Snowball Character,"A character that becomes more deadly the more often they hit you. These characters tend to start the match at their weakest, and once they get their momentum going, they will just get more powerful, like the proverbial snowball rolling down a hill.   This is sometimes tied to a specific resource; for example, Killer Instinct's Spinal starts the match without any of his unique ""skull"" resource, and earns skulls as he hits you. He can then use these skulls to make his offense safer, open up new mixups, and deny you precious resources to fight back, all while continuing to build more skulls. If you can't stem the tide early and let Spinal build up, you might just get totally flattened."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Yomi Counter,"A mechanic for avoiding throws in Fantasy Strike. Rather than try to throw tech by pressing buttons, instead you're asked to input nothing â€” no directions on your joystick and no button presses at all. If someone tries to throw you in this state, you will do damage by automatically throwing them instead. Like most throw systems, you can use common option selects like delay tech (in this case by alternating between blocking and not blocking) to make it easier to avoid being thrown."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Edge,"The edge of a stage or platform in a platform fighter. People will often say ""ledge"" as well, but this specifically means the edge of the stage (not a mid-stage platform). If you get launched off the stage, the stage edge will be the closest part of the stage you can aim for during your recovery, and in Smash Bros., you can grab onto any ledge and pull yourself up as part of your recovery efforts.  Stopping people from grabbing the edge effectively is a huge part of edge-guarding, the cat-and-mouse game of a launched opponent trying to safely return to the stage. In some games you can edge hog and in others you can ledge trump, but the focus is usually around the edge because grabbing it gives your character a short period of invincibility, which is pretty useful for not getting smoked."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Dragon Punch,"A powerful rising uppercut attack that is great for anti-air and is usually invincible, making it great for reversal attacks. A dragon punch, or ""DP"" as it is commonly abbreviated, is a big catch-all term for any motion attack (usually a DP motion) that sees the character attack towards the air with their fist, usually leaving their feet.  They were first seen with Ryu and Ken's shoryuken attacks in Street Fighter II, and as such usually most shotos have a version of it, but this style of attack is now extremely common in dozens of fighting games and hundreds of fighting game characters. This term is basically synonymous with shoryuken and uppercut, although ""DP"" is the most common just because it's catchy and short."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Unsafe,"A move that, when it is blocked, will let your opponent hit you for free before you can block or otherwise avoid their move. It is the opposite of being safe. You might also say the move is punishable. Moves that are unsafe are usually risky to use, but they tend to be pretty strong... maybe they're highly damaging, able to start a long combo, or invincible in some way.  Much like measuring whether a move is safe, the inner workings of being unsafe is a race between the block stun of a move and the recovery of a move. If the recovery takes a long time and the opponent leaves block stun much earlier, they'll have enough time to wind up a move and hit before the recovery completes. Knowing whether a move is safe or unsafe when it is blocked is one of the first steps to using frame data well."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Force Function,"A unique ability for each character in Under Night In-Birth, done by pressing B+C. Depending on the character, it might be an attack, a throw, a new movement option, a dodge, or something else entirely. Force Functions are powerful, so they will cost you one square of your GRD gauge to use (or, if you don't have any GRD, it will build one square for your opponent). It's best to think of them like a cool special move that isn't mapped to a motion command, a bit like Street Fighter V's V-Skill."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,RTSD,"Rush That Shit Down. A phrase commonly used by American fighting game legend Alex Valle to describe games, life, and everything in between. I suppose it can be roughly translated to ""just do it"", but really, it's taken on a life of its own at this point."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Reflect,"A defensive mechanic in Dragon Ball FighterZ that pushes your opponent away if you can successfully parry an attack. It's performed by pressing back + the S button while in neutral, and if your opponent doesn't attack, you'll whiff the attempted parry and most likely get punished.  The end result is similar to pushblocking, although you can't do this technique while blocking like in other team games, and it's quite a bit riskier because you leave yourself open if you're wrong. But if the opponent did attack, you'll create some much needed space, and you can even cancel the end of a successful reflect with some attacks, which might give you a punish opportunity of your own!"
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Getup,"A set of system-wide actions you can take in Mortal Kombat 11 as you are waking up. You can do a ""Getup Attack"", which is effectively a reversal attack; this costs 1 Defensive Meter and 1 Offensive Meter and you can pick between an invincible but low damage attack, or an attack that starts a combo but isn't invincible. You can also tech roll either backwards or forwards for just 1 Defensive Meter, although like most rolls, this can be thrown if your opponent predicts it. You can also do a Delayed Getup (for free), which keeps your back on the ground a little longer and might mess up your opponent's attack timing."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Armor Break,"An attack that is specifically designed to go through armor as if it wasn't there, hitting the character normally. In Killer Instinct, for example, all grounded heavy normals will always break armor, so they are strong tools to use against a character like Aganos who likes being armored for most of the match. Some games will play a special visual or audio effect if armor gets broken. If you break the armor from a Street Fighter IV focus attack, for instance, the game plays a glass shattering sound effect."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Ledgedash,"Falling off a ledge in Smash Bros. Melee, then jumping and wavelanding onto the stage very quickly. If you do this correctly, you'll retain the invincibility you get from grabbing the ledge, and slip back onto the stage without a ton of risk.  You can even attack during this invincibility period, which makes this method of recovery pretty strong! Smash players have a term for how many frames your character is both invincible and able to attack after a ledgedash; they call it GALINT for Grounded Actionable Ledge INTangibility. It's a bit of a mouthful, but having lots of GALINT is good, so try to do your ledgedashes crisply to maximize the GALINTial benefits."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Conversion,"Turning an unlikely hit or a scramble into a combo through great situational awareness. Sometimes you might hit your opponent with a random move that you weren't expecting to hit, but if you're really on the ball, you can invent some on-the-fly way to get more damage out of it. It's less common in games like Street Fighter, but in team games or anime games, characters are flying everywhere and stray hits at weird angles constantly happen, which makes wacky conversions commonplace at high level play."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Meteor Smash,"An attack that hits the opponent at a sharp downwards angle. These are great for interrupting a recovering opponent and maybe even gimping them when they have low damage.  In Smash Bros. Melee and Brawl, characters were able to jump or use an up+B recovery move right after being hit by a meteor smash, which canceled their downward momentum and could maybe save them from death. This is called ""meteor canceling"". In the other Smash Bros. titles, meteor canceling is not possible, so you'll have to get sent the full downward distance before you can try to recover. A downward hit that can't be meteor canceled is called a spike, and since meteor canceling is not a thing in modern Smash games, ""meteor smash"" and ""spike"" are often used interchangeably. For older titles like Melee, though, there is a difference between the terms."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Anchor,"Your final character in a team game. In games with assists, your anchor is often a character that can fight well on their own, or perhaps make the best use of the game's comeback factor, like X-Factor. In a game like King of Fighters, your anchor is likely just the character you are most skilled with, giving you the best chance to close out the fight, or the character that can do the most damage with all the super meter that's gone unused from the rest of your team."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Shadow Move,"An enhanced special move in Killer Instinct that costs one bar of shadow meter to perform. They're essentially EX moves with the added touch of a screen freeze, so they're kind of a combination of EX moves and supers."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Low Crush,"A move that is designed to avoid low attacks. In games with a crush system, this is because your move is specifically programmed to be unhittable by any attack marked as a low hit. In some communities, though, it's also used to describe a move that pulls your hurtbox up a bit so it just avoids attacks that are low to the ground. This can also be described as ""lower body invincibility"" to indicate that your lower body will phase through attacks. The opposite effect is a high crush. You might very, very rarely hear the term high profile used instead of low crush, but it's so rare that I wouldn't worry about it."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Mash,"The act of pressing a ton of buttons rapidly without any thought. Lots of beginners will randomly mash, because they don't know what attacks they should be using. Try not to do this if you can! Even if you're confused, it's better to try and find one or two useful attacks and use those. That said, mashing is a mechanic in some fighting games. You can usually mash buttons to reduce the amount of time you are stunned, and in some Versus games, mashing will increase the damage done by certain super attacks."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Chain Shift,"A powerful option available to an Under Night In-Birth character once they have won a GRD cycle and have entered Vorpal. By pressing the D button twice, you will immediately end your Vorpal state and convert all of your current GRD squares into tons of EXS gauge. In addition, you'll get a powerful screen freeze, so if you do this while in neutral, you'll get to see what your opponent is doing and choose any counter-attack of your choice.  You don't have to use it from neutral, though. You can cancel pretty much any hit or blocked attack (and even some whiffed ones), from the ground or in the air, using Chain Shift. Use this to make attacks safe or to extend your pressure in creative ways. In this sense, it shares a lot of similarities to Guilty Gear's Roman Cancel, but you only get one per Vorpal."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Genei Jin,"An install super for Yun in the Street Fighter series. I'll be talking about the version in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, which is notably one of the most powerful supers in fighting game history. Yun activates a special custom combo mode that lets him cancel attacks together repeatedly, gain huge frame advantage on all his attacks, and string together long juggle combos that can do huge damage. In addition, the length of the super gauge is short, which means it is quite common for Yun to finish one activation and use it again only a few seconds later.  The super is so powerful that building meter for Genei Jin is Yun's plan for the start, middle, and end of every round. When he doesn't have the meter, he will often run away and build meter safely from a distance so he can activate it and charge in. When he does have meter, he will create virtually inescapable mixups involving strikes and command grabs, deal damage, then repeat the process. Despite how degenerate Genei Jin is, using it effectively takes quite a bit of practice and experience (especially for things like the daipan loop), so you'd best get to training."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Magic Pixel,"A term used to describe an opponent who has no visible health remaining on their health bar, but are somehow still alive and fighting. It's normally only a big deal if someone is making a huge, unlikely comeback with no life remaining. Especially in games with chip damage, these usually end up being pretty exciting."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Double Jump Cancel,"Canceling the very early stages of your Smash Bros. double jump directly into an aerial attack. Often shortened to DJC. This only works in Smash 64 and Melee, and only for the four characters with ""loopy"" double jumps that start with a downwards trajectory: Ness, Yoshi, Peach, and Mewtwo. By attacking quickly out of your second jump, you will not travel upwards and instead cancel all your momentum, immediately landing on the ground after your aerial.  It's an even faster way to do low-to-the-ground aerials than SHFFLing them, and it lets you apply really scary pressure. From Smash Bros. Brawl and onward, doing an aerial at the start of a loopy double jump doesn't cancel your upwards momentum, so the technique no longer applies except for a few extremely character specific tricks."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Skill Ceiling,"The absolute peak of skill possible by a human in a game, assuming basically unlimited time and knowledge. If a game's interactions are pretty straightforward and easy to understand, or if there aren't a lot of interesting options that require practice, the skill ceiling will be pretty low. If a game is filled with tons of esoteric character knowledge, there are many interlocking system mechanics, and you'll have to make difficult snap decisions quickly, these things will give a skilled player a huge edge and the skill ceiling will be pretty high. We hope most games have a huge skill ceiling, or else they tend to stop being interesting much faster. You can also discuss a game's skill floor."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Crew Battle,"A Smash Bros. match where two teams play against each other, trying to eliminate all members of the other team in a Pokemon style structure. These are common ways to hold money matches in Smash, and each ""crew"" is often a group of players from the same region. In an interesting twist to normal team events, the winner of a match doesn't start the next match with a full number of stocks. Instead, the number of stocks they ended the last game with is how they begin the next game, which makes every stock important."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Ditto,What Smash Bros. players call a mirror match.
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Cancel,"Removing the recovery of an attack, usually so that you can transition immediately into another move. By far the most common instance is canceling a normal attack into a special move. To do this, input the normal and then immediately input the special move. If the normal hits the opponent, it will kinda stop halfway through and the special move will start immediately. Some people call this standard cancel a 2-in-1 and it has formed the basis of Street Fighter and other 2D games for decades. You'll typically see a cancel notated with ""xx"", like HP xx fireball.  It's far from the only type of canceling in fighting games, though. Sometimes you can cancel a normal into itself (called chaining), or a normal into other normals (called a target combo or a string). You might even be able to cancel a move into nothing, recovering instantly and able to take a new action of your choice (for example, with Guilty Gear's Roman Cancel). Canceling is a staple of the genre, and a concept every fighting game player should know."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Fast Fall,"Pressing down while in the air to instantly accelerate to your character's maximum falling speed. Attacking after a fast fall is a crucial skill in Smash Bros. Melee, since it lets many characters perform several powerful aerial attacks in rapid succession, hitting the ground between each one. It's part of the core of SHFFLing."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Tracking,"The ability for an attack in a 3D game like Tekken or Soulcalibur to hit you as you are sidestepping. A large part of defense in these games is moving laterally to make certain attacks whiff, but moves with good tracking tend to have beefy hitboxes extending laterally to one (or both!) sides of the character, so it's just extra hard to use sidestepping to get out of the way.  Because tracking is hitbox-based, it's kind of a sliding scale. Depending on the defender's dash speed and the size of the hitbox, some moves will be able to full track a character no matter which direction they sidestep, or maybe it will hit if you step one direction but miss if you step the other. There's also the homing attack, which forces the offensive character to turn and face you, no matter how you tried to move to avoid it, and you basically can't sidestep these at all."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Airborne,"The state of being in the air. This one seems like it should be pretty easy! I mean, you're airborne if you jump, and that's that, right? Well, yes, but sometimes games will consider you airborne as a property of a move, even if it looks like you're pretty much on the ground. For example, in some games, backdashing will briefly put you in an airborne state, which might change which moves you'll choose to use when trying to hit a backdash. It is mostly used for jumps like you thought, but just be careful about these weird edge cases."
?,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=rand,Float,"Hitting your Tekken opponent into the air in a way that doesn't involve using a launcher. For example, if you catch your opponent jumping and hit them with a quick attack, you will float them and can follow up with a combo almost as if you had launched them. There are other ways you can float your opponent, depending on which version of Tekken you're playing, so look out for them and capitalize with big damage."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,2D Game,"Any fighting game where your movement is locked to a 2D plane â€” that is to say, you can only move left, right, up, or down. Note that it doesn't matter if the game's art style is pixel-based, or rendered with 3D models; all that matters is how the characters are allowed to move. Although, some people will call a 2D game that uses 3D models a ""2.5D game"".  Most fighting games are 2D, including popular franchises like Street Fighter, Smash Bros., King of Fighters, and Marvel vs. Capcom. They differ from 3D games in that they often have considerably more aspects of space control, like zoning and fireballs, and jumping is usually a way more prominent fixture."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,2-in-1,"Old-school slang for canceling a normal into a special move. The name comes from the fact that you turned 1 hit into 2 hits. I think it's more common to just use the term ""cancel"" or ""special cancel"" these days, but you'll come across this term often when reading discussion on older games."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,09er,"Someone who started playing fighting games in 2009 with the release of Street Fighter IV, pronounced ""oh-niner"". It's supposed to be a bit of an insult, since 09ers were the new kids on the block who didn't know how fighting games worked. But many years later, all those players are veterans now, so the term is just generally used to joke about when someone started playing. You can take the joke further by changing the year as needed, so a 16er would be someone whose first game is Street Fighter V."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,8 Way Run,"The governing method of movement in the Soulcalibur series that lets you freely and easily move in all 8 directions. You can hold any direction and start to run that way; left and right move you closer to or further from your opponent, down and up move you toward and away from the camera respectively (you can also Quick Step vertically), and the diagonals will do both at once. You can freely change your direction while you are moving.  Some commands can only be performed out of certain directions in an 8WR, so check your move list carefully. Because there is a brief bit of startup on the movement, if you want to quickly access these 8WR moves from a standstill, you will typically double-tap (and then hold) the direction before pressing your button."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,360,"A joystick motion used to execute some special moves, almost always a command throw like a Spinning Piledriver. On paper, it requires a full 360-degree rotation of your joystick, starting at any one direction and ending at the same place. In practice, most games have a shortcut for this input; usually a 270-degree input will do. So, for example, you could do a half circle forward, and then keep going and end at the up direction, and that will probably work just fine. You might think it's hard to do this motion and not get an accidental jump, but if you do it fast enough, you'll be fine."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,6-Button Fighter,"A fighting game that uses 3 strengths for punch attacks (light punch, medium punch, heavy punch) and 3 strengths for kick attacks (light kick, medium kick, heavy kick). The various entries in the Street Fighter series are by far the most common 6-button fighting games. There are some team games that use 6 distinct buttons, like Marvel vs. Capcom, but some of those buttons are dedicated to calling assists. You could probably make the definition fit if you were in a pinch, but it's not how most people will use the term. There are many fighting games that only use 4 primary attacks as well."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,0 to Death,"A Smash Bros.-specific term for a touch of death combo. Since Smash health bars are measured in percent starting at 0%, this just describes the same phenomenon of your health bar getting nuked in a slightly different way. Smash usually has stuff like directional influence to let you escape combos, but 0 to death sequences will sometimes include when the offensive player correctly reads the DI escape attempt and keeps the combo up (and in some cases, a ""true"" 0 to death won't have any DI escape possible)."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,720,"A joystick motion used to execute some supers that requires two complete spins (a full 720-degree rotation) of your analog stick. The supers that take these inputs are almost always lightning fast command throws that do a huge grip of damage.  Unlike the 360 motion, it is very difficult to do this motion without accidentally jumping, even if the game has a slight shortcut for the command. As a result, you usually need a bit of a trick to input it, like jumping first and doing the motion as you land, or whiffing a move on purpose and ""hiding"" most of the input while your character is swinging. This is intentional, because a move this strong needs to take a bit of time to input and require some planning, or else it will just be way too good. If you're an absolute beast, and the game allows it, you can try to do a standing 720, but good luck."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,1-Frame Link,"A link that only has a 1-frame window to succeed, the smallest possible time interval in a fighting game. You'll know you have a 1-frame link on your hands if the on hit advantage number for your first move matches the startup number for the second move (for example, a +5 on hit attack linking into a move that hits on the 5th frame).  In some games, it's as tight as it sounds; you'll just have to hit the link perfectly with a just frame input with no tricks to save you. But in most games, you'll get a bit of help to make the link easier. For example, there are input tricks like plinking and pianoing that will give you multiple shots to hit the window. And the game itself might have an input buffer which will save and apply your input on the correct frame if you hit it a little early. So despite how hard it may sound, hitting the exact 1-frame window isn't always necessary."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,4-Button Fighter,"A fighting game that uses only 4 primary attack buttons. This will commonly be 2 punch buttons and 2 kick buttons, as you'll see in King of Fighters and Tekken, but you may also see some other creative layouts; Blazblue and Under Night In-Birth use three attacks (light, medium, heavy) and a special ""Drive"" button that controls various system mechanics. Despite having fewer buttons than their 6-button counterparts, 4-button fighters are still plenty deep, complex, and engaging."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,3-Out System,"A format used for pools in double elimination tournaments that sees one player on the winners side and two players (rather than just one) on the losers side qualify to the next set of pools. In essence, instead of the two players on the losers side playing to try and get out of the pool, they will both qualify to opposite ends of the next bracket, so they won't have to face each other. This lets you avoid a bunch of annoying double jeopardy situations where it's quite likely someone will lose twice to the same player. Many big tournaments now use this method."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,10-String,"A Tekken string that almost always hits 10 times. Every character has at least one 10-string, although the inputs will be different between characters. They're kind of seen as a gimmick, since once the string begins, the sequence is the same each time. Some of the hits will be low and some might be high or mid, and it's up to the defender to just remember the sequence and switch their blocking direction as needed, like a game of Simon Says played from memory. If you forget the sequence, or are new to Tekken, odds are you're just going to get tagged instead."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,3D Game,"Any fighting game where you can move anywhere in 3D space â€” that is to say, you can move left, right, up, or down, as well as ""in"" and ""out"" of the camera. All 3D fighting games need to use 3D models, but some 2D games will use 3D models as well, so check the game's movement options to make the proper classification.  The most popular 3D fighting game franchises are Tekken, Soulcalibur, Virtua Fighter, and Dead or Alive. Some prominent 2D franchises have tried 3D games as experiments, like King of Fighters: Maximum Impact, but their modern entries have gone back to 2D movement. Most 3D games tend to focus more on up-close brawling, where learning how to sidestep around moves instead of blocking them is a big part of the strategy."
#,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=num,50/50,"A mixup that has two possible primary options for the attacker, with each option requiring a different defensive action. Typically this is used to describe difficult to block cross-up attacks, which force you to choose between blocking left or right, or a mixup between a good low and overhead, which force you to choose between blocking high or low. Even being directly in your opponent's face can be a mixup between attacking and throwing; this is often called a ""strike/throw"" mixup.  They're named this way because it can feel like you have only a 50% chance of defending correctly. If you're struggling with these, you might check to see if any option selects exist in your favorite game that can help you deal with basic 50/50s, like fuzzy blocking or delayed throw teching."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Aerial Attack,"An attack in Super Smash Bros. done by pressing A button in the air with an optional direction (or by using the C-stick). Like smash attacks, you append a letter for the direction (or ""n"" for neutral) and write ""air"" after it. So a down-aerial is written as ""dair"" and pronounced as one syllable.  These are effectively your character's air normals and they are some of the strongest, most useful, most spammable moves in any Smash Bros. game. Many characters have extremely potent killing moves on at least one of their aerials, and they can be used for prolonged juggles, stage control, edge-guarding, and playing Smash's version of footsies. Of all the attacks to understand for your character, your aerials should probably be first on the list."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Air Dodge,"A Smash Bros. mechanic that lets you turn yourself invincible in the air, dodging attacks. The specifics change depending on which version of Smash you're playing, with each game having its own flavor of air dodging which allows for various offensive and defensive strategies.  In some games, you can air dodge as many times as you want in the same jump, while in others, you can only air dodge once and must touch the ground before you can do it again. Sometimes you can do other actions in the air after an air dodge, while other times you will start to freefall. In some games, you just air dodge in place, while in others (notably Melee), you can steer your air dodge in a direction. This is the primary mechanic that allows wavedashing to work. The mechanic really takes a unique identity in each game.  Melty Blood also uses an Air Dodge system. It makes you briefly invincible like you'd expect, but it's fast and also shifts your aerial momentum slightly, which is a powerful tool for adjusting your angle of approach in an aerial-based fighter like Melty."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Active Flow,"A state you can enter in BlazBlue if you attack with your character often enough, which provides a few nice passive benefits. When you've done enough offensive actions and finally land a certain attack, your gauges will all turn purple and you'll be in Active Flow for around 14 seconds. You'll get a small damage boost and your Burst gauge will regenerate faster, among other positive effects. You can even extend this timer by using your Overdrive if you like."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Active,"The period of time that a move has a hitbox and is capable of doing damage to the opponent. It's one of the three stages of an attack, along with startup and recovery, and is measured in frames. After your move undergoes some brief startup (the windup phase), then the active period starts, where your character's fist is finally able to connect with your friend's jaw. Then, you have to suffer the recovery (the cooldown phase) before you can move again.  Despite the active frames being the only time a move can do damage, it makes up a surprisingly small percentage of a move's total duration; usually moves only have around 1-4 active frames, even though the move itself might take 30 frames from start to finish. You don't have to focus on this number too much while you're learning how to read frame data, but you'll learn it's most useful for picking a good meaty attack."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Air Combo,The act of comboing an airborne opponent while you are also in the air. Air combos are a staple of most anime games and the Versus series.
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Air Dash,"Using a dash while in the air. Some characters with air dashes can only dash in one direction, while others can dash in up to all 8 cardinal directions. Air dashes are very common in anime games and the Versus series but are quite uncommon in other fighting games. When they exist, they greatly speed up the pace of the game and generally make playing defense pretty hard, especially if you do it instantly."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Abare,"Attacking while you are at negative frame advantage. Pronounced ah-BAR-ray, at least by English speakers. Normally attacking while your opponent is plus is a bad idea, since if they press their fastest attack, they're going to win. But... sometimes opponents don't press their fastest attack! Maybe they want to stretch their advantage a little too far and, say, take extra time to walk up and throw. If you abare in these situations, you'll probably land some hits.  Just be careful, though. There's always some risk that your opponent will just attack quickly and counter hit you. Abare is very closely tied to the concept of turns, and was first brought over as a loan word from Virtua Fighter. In fact, VF has a related concept called moral, which is kind of the opposite of abare."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Absolute Guard,"A game mechanic that forces your character to block all incoming attacks while you are trapped in block stun, even if you let go of the joystick. As long as your opponent attacks you with a true block string, you're just stuck.  Most games will typically have absolute guard, but a game like SFIII: 3rd Strike, which lets you red parry while you are blocking, will not have absolute guard so you can be hit if you mess it up. Some games will even automatically switch your block from low to high or auto-block cross-ups while you are in block stun, but this is a game-specific choice."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Advantage,"Usually refers to frame advantage â€” that is, who is allowed to attack first after some move hits or is blocked. You might say ""you can't press a button there, I'm advantage"" to indicate that you are plus, or you can also talk about it from the perspective of the player who is minus, saying they are at disadvantage. It also might refer to who wins in a certain matchup, such as ""I think Ken has an advantage against Ryu""."
A,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=A,Aerial Control,"The ability to change your character's trajectory after being hit into the air in Soulcalibur. By holding a direction on the joystick, you might be able to steer yourself away from a potential Ring Out, or just avoid other follow-up hits in a juggle. It is reminiscent of directional influence in Smash Bros."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Balance,"A measure of how strong a game's characters are, compared to each other. If most characters in a game have relatively similar chances to win, then you might say the game is pretty balanced. If there are a couple particularly broken strategies or characters that dominate all others, then the game would be pretty imbalanced. Perfect balance is impossible to achieve, and it's debatable whether balance is that important to fun factor anyway, since many of the genre's most exciting games have some pretty dominant characters. But imbalanced games fall apart pretty quickly without a fair bit of game design luck, so I wouldn't recommend designing it that way on purpose."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Babality,"A finishing attack performed after winning a game of Mortal Kombat that turns the opponent into an infant. Usually you have to satisfy some extra condition in the winning round to be able to do one; in Mortal Kombat 9's case, for example, you have to win the final round without blocking. It's a play on the Fatality."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Back Roll,"The act of rolling away from the opponent in a soft knockdown situation, although not every game allows for you to roll when your back hits the ground. Usually the term is reserved for these situations, even though games like Smash Bros. allow you to roll at any point during the fight."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Ball Top,"A style of joystick used in an arcade stick that looks like a giant gumball on top of a small rod. This is the common style used in Japanese arcades, and is the default joystick on pretty much all of the stock arcade sticks you'll buy today (although you can still find bat tops around too).  There are many ways to hold a ball top; you'll typically rest part of your wrist on the base of the stick and subtly push and pull the ball with different parts of your hand as necessary, not using a ton of the wrist. Or, you might see some players hold it like a wine glass, which uses more wrist for basic movement. Just don't try to use it by grabbing the ball with your hand elevated off any support. You can't be precise enough and you'll get sore pretty fast."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,B-Reverse,"A technique in Smash Bros. that causes you to face the other way and also reverse the direction you're traveling as soon as you perform a special move. It was first introduced in Smash Bros. Brawl and has been in all versions of Smash since. To do this, input your special move, and then immediately tap the opposite direction after.  B-Reversing lets you do a bunch of cool things, like running away from the opponent and then suddenly changing your momentum to fly back at their face while attacking with a projectile. It's common to get B-Reverse confused with Turnaround-B (gee, I can't imagine why) and the wavebounce. It helps to remember that if ""reverse"" is in the name of the term, it's the one that reverses everything (both your momentum and the direction you're facing)."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Bait,"Doing something specific to induce a certain move from your opponent, and then countering it perfectly. In other words, it's tricking them into thinking some attack or movement option was a good idea, and then showing them very clearly that it wasn't. Perhaps the most common bait is walking up to an opponent you've knocked down, threatening to attack, then blocking their reversal dragon punch; doing this successfully is ""baiting the DP"". You can also bait attempts to throw tech by walking up to them, pretending to throw, then walking back. This is a common enough strategy that we've even given it a name."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Backdash,"Inputting the back direction twice to dash backwards. In many modern fighting games, you are briefly invincible while backdashing, which can let you escape your opponent's pressure. But even if that's not the case, backdashing is often very useful to suddenly create a good amount of space between you and your opponent. If they attack at the right time, you can make attacks whiff and maybe even score a punish."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Bar,"A small segment of super meter. Also often called a stock. The entire super meter is typically divided into several bars, which can each be individually spent on actions such as EX moves."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Balcony Break,"Punching someone through a wall that acts as an overhang to a new part of the stage below. It is effectively a combination of a wall break and a floor break, and only possible on a select few stages. Like the other ""breaks"", you need to use a specific move to break the wall and you'll get to continue the combo afterward. A lot of these stage destruction abilities have extremely similar uses in matches, just different aesthetics to match the various stage locales."
B,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=B,Back Turn,"Facing away from your opponent, with your back to them. Some moves will leave you with your back turned to your opponent, and you can access special techniques while doing this (think of it almost like a stance if you like). Moves that have to be executed from a back turn are often labeled BT."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Canadian Burst,"Bursting while your character is at the top of the screen, and your opponent is nowhere near you. It's just the worst burst ever. It had no chance of hitting at all, and now you're gonna get massively punished too. Were you even looking at the screen?   Usually this happens because you panicked or were too slow to realize what was happening, but there are some legitimate reasons too! Some combo paths launch you at strange angles and you might have to try bursting before the opponent gets near you, so you can look mighty silly if they didn't continue the sequence. You'll sometimes hear this called a ""Domi Burst"" after the strong Japanese anime player Domi, who for some reason seems to do this a lot. Like the Chicago Punish and other self-deprecating regional terms, feel free to replace ""Canadian"" with your own region."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Caliburst,"Bursting when you are extremely low on life and your opponent has most of their health bar remaining (assuming it's not the final round, of course). It's a super aggressive play... are you really going to make that comeback? Bursts don't grow on trees, so you're usually better off saving this super precious resource for a round you actually have a chance at winning! If you lose, you're down a round and without your Burst, so now you're in real trouble. But then again, since many Californian players love to play all-in rushdown styles, it seems to fit the namesake pretty well."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Casuals,"Playing matches for fun where the results don't matter. Casuals are basically everything that isn't a tournament match or a money match, and you might ask to get some casuals in whenever you go to a local gathering or during downtime at a tournament."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Chain Grab,"A Smash Bros. combo where you throw someone many times in a row. Chain grabs are dependent on a lot of factors, including your opponent's character, stage positioning, how much damage they've taken, and which direction you throw them after grabbing them. Sometimes your opponent can make continuing the chain grab difficult by using DI, forcing you to react and change your followups, but other times the chain grab is just guaranteed to work with no problems until a certain damage threshold has been reached.  Famous chain grabs include Melee's Marth on the space animals and Brawl's Dedede on, well, pretty much everyone. Starting in Smash Bros. 4 and onward, being thrown once makes you impossible to throw again for about 1 second, effectively eliminating this technique."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Challenge,"To attack your opponent as they are trying to attack you. The most common way this is used is when you attack after you leave block stun, trying to remind your opponent that you're still playing. This isn't always a good idea, but if it works, you might hear ""oh, nice challenge"".  You can also try to intercept someone who's moving in while you're playing neutral. So if your opponent starts dashing in, or if they do some full screen special move like a gorilla, you can press a button to try and hit them before they reach you. In this case, you're ""challenging"" their approach."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Cash Out,"The act of performing an ender in Killer Instinct to convert all the white life sitting on your opponent's health bar into pure damage. Any combo involving an ender, as long as it is not opener-ender, will always cash out the damage automatically. You'll mostly use the term to describe strategy, like ""look at all that white life, he needs to cash it out!"""
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Chain,"The ability to cancel a normal into itself. In many 2D fighting games, most characters will be able to chain their light punch or light kick attacks together to create a basic combo (or block string). Chains usually involve crouching normals, but can also use standing normals, and may even mix and match them!   The difference between a chain and a target combo is that a chain deals with the same normal, where target combos deal with different normals, but the distinction is pretty skin deep and you'll hear some people talk about any normal canceled into any other normal as a chain, especially in team games or in some older titles like Darkstalkers. You might also hear people talk about linking normals together instead of chaining them."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Catch Throw,"A special class of throw in Virtua Fighter that can't be teched and will also beat attacks that are in their startup. This last point is important, since Virtua Fighter's RPS system means attacks will always beat normal throws, so catch throws kind of break a cardinal interaction rule in VF. CTs aren't perfectly analogous to command throws in other fighting games, but they share some similar DNA in that they behave just differently enough from a regular throw to force your defense against them to change."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Chain Shift,"A powerful option available to an Under Night In-Birth character once they have won a GRD cycle and have entered Vorpal. By pressing the D button twice, you will immediately end your Vorpal state and convert all of your current GRD squares into tons of EXS gauge. In addition, you'll get a powerful screen freeze, so if you do this while in neutral, you'll get to see what your opponent is doing and choose any counter-attack of your choice.  You don't have to use it from neutral, though. You can cancel pretty much any hit or blocked attack (and even some whiffed ones), from the ground or in the air, using Chain Shift. Use this to make attacks safe or to extend your pressure in creative ways. In this sense, it shares a lot of similarities to Guilty Gear's Roman Cancel, but you only get one per Vorpal."
C,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=C,Cancel,"Removing the recovery of an attack, usually so that you can transition immediately into another move. By far the most common instance is canceling a normal attack into a special move. To do this, input the normal and then immediately input the special move. If the normal hits the opponent, it will kinda stop halfway through and the special move will start immediately. Some people call this standard cancel a 2-in-1 and it has formed the basis of Street Fighter and other 2D games for decades. You'll typically see a cancel notated with ""xx"", like HP xx fireball.  It's far from the only type of canceling in fighting games, though. Sometimes you can cancel a normal into itself (called chaining), or a normal into other normals (called a target combo or a string). You might even be able to cancel a move into nothing, recovering instantly and able to take a new action of your choice (for example, with Guilty Gear's Roman Cancel). Canceling is a staple of the genre, and a concept every fighting game player should know."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Dash Dance,"Canceling the initial frames of your dash into a dash in the other direction, then rapidly repeating this process so you wiggle left and right. Dash dancing gives you tons of unpredictability in your movement, especially for characters like Melee's Marth, who travel very far in their initial dash and can change direction for a long time. Mixed with wavedashing, you can be almost anywhere on the screen at any time, facing the direction you choose."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Danger Time,"A state that a Guilty Gear Xrd match will sometimes enter when two attacks clash. The match will pause, the screen will go dark, and a 3 second countdown appears. After the countdown finishes, the match resumes and the stakes are cranked way, way up. Damage is increased 20%, but more importantly, pretty much every hit you land from a neutral state will be a ""Mortal Counter"", a juiced up counter hit state that gives ridiculous hit stun and crazy combo possibilities. Danger Time happens completely randomly, so you can't control when it starts, but it almost always results in someone getting smoked. Just be sure it's the other guy and not you."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Damage Scaling,"A system that reduces the damage for each hit in a combo more and more as the combo gets longer. So for example, maybe the first two hits of your combo do 100% of their regular damage value, but then the third hit does 80%, the fourth 70%, and so on down to some minimum, like 10%.  Its goal is to try and keep the damage of long combos in check; in a system without damage scaling, open-ended combo systems would get wildly out of control as creative players come up with techniques the developers didn't foresee. Pretty much every single fighting game beyond the truly ancient ones has some form of damage scaling. It's also similar in concept to proration, which is kind of a ""per move"" version of this system, and some games will do both at the same time!"
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Daipan Loop,"An advanced combo for Yun in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. While in Genei Jin, Yun rapidly performs several heavy punch attacks (or ""daipan""s) in a row, each of them kara'ed from a standing medium punch in order to keep Yun moving forward.  This combo loop requires very precise timing and spacing, which changes depending on which character you're hitting and whether they are standing or crouching. The damage is massive though, especially on crouching characters, and very advanced Yun players will nuke health bars with this whenever they can. It's similar to another Yun combo called Keeper Jin, but this one does more damage and tends to be the go-to for more situations, if you've practiced the timing."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Damage Over Time,"A status effect where you slowly take damage, even if your opponent isn't attacking you. Commonly abbreviated as DOT, and pronounced as one syllable. If you play any other videogame genres, you'll be used to this type of effect, but it's not terribly common in fighting games. FANG in Street Fighter V and General RAAM in Killer Instinct are examples of characters that can do damage over time."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Dash,"Tapping the forward or backward direction twice to move your character a short distance across the ground quickly. While dashing, you cannot block, making dashing a riskier way to cover ground than simply walking. In many modern fighting games, dashing backwards (called ""backdashing"") grants you some brief invincibility, which can give you a way to escape your opponent's close range pressure. In some fighting games, it is possible to dash in the air, too."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Dead Angle,"A defensive technique in Guilty Gear that lets you attack while you are blocking. For the cost of 50% of your Tension, press forward plus any two attacks while in block stun and you will do a basic attack that knocks the opponent away from you, giving you some room to breathe. It's quite similar to the alpha counter and the V-Reversal, and similar ideas are in many games, just with different names. In Guilty Gear Strive, Dead Angle is replaced by Yellow Roman Cancel, but the idea is very similar."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Dashback,"Dashing in the opposite direction you're facing in Smash Bros., causing your character to turn around and start a dash in a new direction. Doing this seems easy on paper (simply smash the analog stick behind you), but in Smash Bros. Melee in particular, dashing backwards is considerably more difficult than just dashing forwards, since you have to enter a brief ""turnaround"" animation, slowing the whole process down. This makes certain techniques like dash dancing and tech chasing more difficult.  To avoid being slowed down by turning around, you have to smash the analog stick from neutral all the way to left or right in 1 frame (sometimes called a ""Smash Turn""). This is extremely difficult, but it's made worse by the fact that some Gamecube controllers are more capable of doing this based on random factors about their build quality. This is one of the issues the Universal Controller Fix software mod for Melee addresses, allowing all controllers to be able to do this equally well."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,DACUS,"A technique in Smash Bros. Brawl (and its fan project Project M) that lets a character kara cancel a dash attack into an up-smash. Stands for, predictably, Dash Attack Canceled Up Smash. This is super useful for characters that get a lot of forward momentum out of the initial frames of their dash attack; all that momentum gets saved while you are doing your up-smash, so you'll slip and slide all over the screen while attacking. It almost kind of looks like a wavedash, but you don't get to act freely out of it. It was a particularly common (and fun!) strategy for Snake, as he had easy execution and an extra long slide."
D,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=D,Dave's Stupid Rule,"A rule in Smash Bros. tournaments that prevents you from picking a stage you've already won a game on during the current match. Commonly abbreviated to DSR. The goal is to prevent players from repeatedly counter picking the same stage that gives them a huge advantage and beating their opponent handily because of it. You'll get to win at most once on this stage, and then you'll have to go elsewhere. Some tournaments have a ""Gentleman's Rule"" that lets the players bypass DSR and play on a previous stage again, but only if they both agree."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,Edge-Guard,"Trying to keep an opponent who you've launched off the stage from returning back to the stage. You might jump off the stage yourself and try to intercept them as they get close, or you might stand right on the edge of the stage and poke at them as they are trying to grab the edge.  The strategies around one player edge-guarding and the other trying to recover safely are one of the main ways Smash Bros. is different from traditional fighting games, and the options each player has will change depending on which version of Smash Bros. (or which platform fighter) you're talking about. You'll hear terms like gimp, edge hog, ledge trump, and others used to describe strategies for edge-guarding."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,Edge,"The edge of a stage or platform in a platform fighter. People will often say ""ledge"" as well, but this specifically means the edge of the stage (not a mid-stage platform). If you get launched off the stage, the stage edge will be the closest part of the stage you can aim for during your recovery, and in Smash Bros., you can grab onto any ledge and pull yourself up as part of your recovery efforts.  Stopping people from grabbing the edge effectively is a huge part of edge-guarding, the cat-and-mouse game of a launched opponent trying to safely return to the stage. In some games you can edge hog and in others you can ledge trump, but the focus is usually around the edge because grabbing it gives your character a short period of invincibility, which is pretty useful for not getting smoked."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,Edge Hog,"Grabbing onto the edge in a platform fighter so that your opponent can't. Very useful in the older Super Smash Bros. games in order to snag the edge from a recovering player who is trying to grab the edge to survive. In Melee in particular, you can grab the edge and then roll back onto the stage; the game thinks you are grabbing the edge for the duration of your roll, allowing you to continue hogging it from your opponent while being invincible from the roll. In later Smash Bros titles, they removed this mechanic in favor of ledge trumping."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,EX Guard,"An advanced form of blocking in Melty Blood: AACC where you press back to block just slightly before an attack reaches you. You'll briefly flash gold and improve your super meter gain, restore some of your guard meter so you don't get guard crushed so quickly, and recover from block stun slightly faster than normal, perhaps allowing new punishes. You'll also push the opponent a little farther away than normal, making it function a little like a pushblock in other games.  It shares a lot of similiarites to Guilty Gear's Instant Block and Just Defend from games like King of Fighters. Despite the term's use of ""EX"", it does not cost meter to perform. Also, only two of the three Moons (Crescent and Full) can do it."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,Ender,"A special move executed with either heavy punch or heavy kick any time after you have hit with a Killer Instinct opener. Depending on which special move you do, your ender will have different perks, such as extra damage, more super meter gain, or a wall splat.  Your ender will also get powered up based on how much white life your opponent has, indicated by a number of green rectangles under the combo counter. Short combos without much white life will be ""level 1"" and give a small reward, while longer combos filled with heavy-hitting attacks can reach ""level 4"", greatly powering up your ender's effect. The ender will also cash out and remove any white life your opponent has, adding to the combo damage significantly. Just be sure not to do an opener-ender sequence."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,EVO Moment #37,"A moment from EVO 2004's Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike tournament that has become one of the most famous moments in fighting game history. Down to a sliver of his remaining health, Japanese fighting game legend Daigo Umehara precisely parried 15 hits of Chun-Li's super, launched by American legend Justin Wong in an attempt to chip Daigo out. Daigo would then punish Justin and win the game, and eventually the match.  This moment has transcended the fighting game genre, inspired millions of fans and, in many ways, is responsible for the modern popularity of fighting games as a whole. The phrase ""Let's go Justin!"", shouted by an onlooker right before the parry begins, has also reached infamy in fighting game circles. The only way to understand the excitement of the moment is to watch it yourself."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,EVO,"The world's largest fighting game tournament. Hosted every summer in Las Vegas, the Evolution Championship Series is a multi-day, open event that hosts tens of thousands of competitors from all around the world in several games. In recent years, EVO has filled the Mandalay Bay arena on Sunday for the Top 8 finals of its more popular games and even been featured on TV channels like ESPN. Starting in 2018, EVO also hosts EVO Japan every January."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,Edge Cancel,"Canceling the recovery of an air attack by landing on the very edge of a platform and then using your existing momentum to slide off. Instead of incurring your normal landing lag, you'll slide off the platform and become airborne again, able to attack immediately. It's not easy to pull off though, since you have to land with some pretty high precision right near the edge, and it's even harder if your character doesn't like to slide very much.  In Smash 64 and Melee, you can edge cancel any aerial attack and open up new combo opportunities. In Brawl and beyond, however, you can only cancel special moves (like your up-B recovery move) and air dodges, so it's now less about combos and more about making survival a little easier."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,Electric Wind God Fist,"An iconic move from the Tekken series belonging to Mishimas. It's often abbreviated to EWGF, simply called an ""Electric"", or called a ""Dorya"", mimicking the iconic voice clip when the move is performed. The command is forward, neutral, down, down-forward + 2 (essentially, a DP motion where you must also hit neutral), but then you must enter the down-forward direction and press your 2 attack on the exact same frame. If your timing is even slightly off, you will get the non-Electric version of the attack, which has considerably worse properties and, let's be honest, doesn't look nearly as cool.  Electrics are powerful moves in Tekken. They are high attacks, which makes them susceptible to crouching, but they are otherwise very fast, plus on block launchers that lead to a massive amount of damage. While the execution is quite difficult, being able to do this attack on command is important to learn for Mishima players."
E,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=E,Empty Jump,"The act of jumping without doing any air attack. There are lots of cool strategic reasons why you might want to do this. For example, if you're a slow moving character with beefy air attacks, you can close the gap by empty jumping. Your opponent might think you want to press one of those wonderful long-range air attacks and try to anti-air you, but since you didn't press anything, they'll swing and miss. This is called a grappler jump.  Since jumping attacks are overheads, another option is empty jumping and then doing an immediate, fast low attack instead as a mixup. We call this ""empty jump low"" and you can also try doing similar ideas like empty jump throw if you want (Smash players call this a tomahawk). I know that everytime you jump you want to attack, but sometimes less is more."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fatal Counter,"A more powerful version of a counter hit in the BlazBlue series. Certain moves are marked with the ability to deliver a Fatal Counter if they counter hit the opponent, and you'll get extra hit stun and a fatter combo when it hits. The announcer shouts ""Fatal"" to let you know when you're in business. It shares similarities with a system like Street Fighter V's Crush Counter.  Fatal Counter is also a mechanic in Melty Blood: Type Lumina. Landing any hit or throw against a shielding opponent, or a counter-hit against someone in the air, pops up the ""Fatal Counter"" message on the screen. You'll get slightly more damage and hit stun than normal, possibly allowing new combos depending on the situation. You'll also earn more moon gauge on a fatal counter, letting you use your powerful moon skills and moon drive more often."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fast-Faller,"A character that has high falling speed and just naturally falls faster towards the stage than other characters. The space animals are common examples of fast-fallers. How fast you fall greatly impacts every aspect of the character; on offense, fast-fallers can quickly throw out aerial attacks and land on the stage, and on defense, opponents can often perform unique combos on them (like chain grabs), since they will fall back into range more quickly than other characters. The opposite of a fast-faller is being floaty. Note that this term is distinct from a fast fall."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,FGC,"An abbreviation for the Fighting Game Community. Anybody who enjoys playing, talking about, or watching fighting games is a part of the FGC, no matter how good you are or which game is your favorite. The FGC is a bit unique compared to other video game communities because rather than focus on exactly one specific game, there are dozens of fighting games that people love to play, so you'll see a lot of diversity in discussion and interests."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Falling Speed,"How fast your character moves downward while in mid-air. Every Smash Bros. character has an inherent falling speed, from the super quick fast-fallers to the slower floaty characters, and by pressing down while in the air, you will fast fall and accelerate your falling speed instantly to its character-specific maximum value."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Force Roman Cancel,"A type of Roman Cancel in the Guilty Gear XX series of games, commonly abbreviated to FRC. The good side: FRCs only cost 25% of your Tension gauge instead of the normal 50%, making them a very economical and powerful use of meter. The bad side: FRCs can't be performed on just any old move. It's only possible on a small subset of moves (often on projectiles), and the timing is notoriously tight, often just a couple frames of leeway during a very specific part of the move's animation. But when you get used to the precision needed, you can generate some pretty effective pressure at a very low meter cost. FRCs generate a blue circle around your character."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Flawless Block,"An advanced blocking technique in Mortal Kombat 11. By pressing the block button right before you are attacked, you will briefly flash white and reduce the chip damage you take. Once you've successfully done a Flawless Block, you can spend 1 Defensive Meter and 1 Offensive Meter by inputting up+2 or up+3 to immediately counter-attack, much like you would do as one of your Getup options. This can let you punish certain attacks that you normally wouldn't be able to. This mechanic is similar to Just Defend and Instant Blocking in other games."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Foxtrotting,"A movement technique where you begin a dash, release your stick to neutral as your initial dash animation completes, then do it again. You never truly enter your full run animation, but instead just repeat your run's startup over and over, which for some characters can be faster and trickier than actually running.  It's just yet another way to move around in Smash Bros., like the dash dance or wavedashing."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Foot Position,"The orientation a character is standing in Virtua Fighter. You can have your left foot forward (LFF) or right foot forward (RFF), and you can switch between these freely, including by using certain attacks which switch your foot position. Thinking about it in terms of feet is a little tricky though, so you might just want to think whether you can see your opponent's ""front"" or ""back"", and you'll learn how this influences the direction you want to do your Defensive Move in.  You might also hear discussion about ""open"" or ""closed"" stances. A closed stance is when both characters have the same foot position (that is, you can see one character's front and the other character's back), and an open stance is when they have opposite foot positions (you see both fronts or both backs). This has subtle implications on the fight, including making some juggle combos impossible if you're facing the opponent the wrong way."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Frame Advantage,"Describes who recovers first when a move hits or is blocked. If you use an attack that recovers before the opponent leaves block stun (or hit stun), you get control of your character back first and can attack before the opponent, if you want. This means you ""have frame advantage"", and it's the same thing as being plus. You can also just ask ""what's the frame advantage on that move?"" to find out if you are plus or minus.  Having positive frame advantage is a bit stronger than just merely being safe, since being safe will also include a few moves that are minus (just not so minus that they can be punished). You'll hear people give advice like ""I'm advantage there, don't press a button"" and when you're first picking up fighting games, you should pay attention."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fish,"Using a highly rewarding move multiple times in a row, hoping your opponent will run into it so something really good happens. A good example is using a good poke and buffering a strong attack behind it, like a super. If you see your opponent swing multiple times with this poke, you might hear a commentator say ""you can see him really fishing for super"". The line has been cast and they are hoping to reel in the big catch."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Focus Attack Dash Cancel,"Holding a focus attack and then, rather than releasing the buttons and attacking, inputting a dash to cancel the attack and dash instead. Specifically, FADC is used to refer to the 2-bar focus attack, those that were canceled off other attacks. You would then immediately dash cancel the focus, often before seeing any animation besides a quick yellow flash, and then continue the combo with other attacks or make yourself safe."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Focus Attack,"A system-wide mechanic in Street Fighter IV which let you absorb incoming attacks by holding MP and MK. You could then release the buttons at any time for a special attack, which might cause a crumple and a huge combo if timed correctly, or you could dash in either direction at any time and not activate the attack. While this has a lot of uses in neutral, its main use was canceling an attack directly into your absorbing pose for 2 stocks of super meter, which you could then dash out of to extend combos. Using it in this way was called a focus attack dash cancel, or FADC, and it was an extremely common tool used many times per match in SFIV.  Focus attack, and in particular FADC, was a divisive mechanic. On one hand, it allowed for flashy, interesting combos and brightened up the otherwise fairly boring combo game of SFIV. On the other hand, it was the cause of several extremely strong defensive mechanics, such as making many dragon punches safe on block and lead to extremely high damage on hit, and the use of the four finger tech. For better and worse, focus attacks contributed to SFIV's unique feel and it has both its fans and its detractors. In Ultra SFIV, the final version of the game, a new mechanic called red focus was added."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fly,"A special move in some team games which allow the character to hover in the air for a set amount of time. While flying, you can typically attack, move around, and air dash until you get hit or you run out of flight time. Fly is often very strong in neutral to move around unpredictably, and you will usually use Fly and Unfly in combos if you manage to land a launcher."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Four Finger Tech,"A close-range defensive technique in Street Fighter IV where you would press four buttons, namely LP+LK+MP+MK, and then input backdash quickly afterwards. This was a powerful option select which overlaps the command for a throw tech (LP+LK) with a focus attack (MP+MK). If the opponent tried to throw you, you would tech the throw. If they tried to attack you, instead the focus attack would come out and you would absorb the hit and immediately use your invincible backdash to get to safety. In many matchups, this was a powerful catch-all defensive option that required some real study, or a strong read, to defeat."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,First to,"Playing a set where the overall winner is the first player to win a certain number of games. Commonly abbreviated to ""FT"" followed by the number of wins required, such as ""FT10"". Most tournament sets will be FT2 or FT3, depending on which game is being played."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fatal Blow,"A powerful super attack in Mortal Kombat 11. They replace X-Rays from Mortal Kombat X. Unlike most games, Fatal Blow is not tied to your super meter. Instead, like Tekken 7's Rage Art, you can only use it when you are low on health. If your Fatal Blow is blocked or whiffs, you'll get it back and can use it again after a short cooldown. However, you only get one successful Fatal Blow per match. If it hits, you won't be able to use it for the rest of the match (even if you are low on health in future rounds). Fatal Blows are fast, have armor and do a grip of damage."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Flowchart,"A basic strategy that can be followed in steps: if the current game state is X, just always do Y. Flowchart is usually used in a derogatory way to indicate a person that never thinks and always does the same thing (and usually loses in the same ways each time). But that said, there's certainly value in following a basic flowchart when you're learning a game. It can reduce the burden of learning everything up front and give you meaningful practice quickly."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Faultless Defense Cancel,"Kara canceling the startup of a Guilty Gear move directly into Faultless Defense. There are a few reasons you'd want to do this, but one common use is to change your air trajectory and try to trick your opponent with a different angle of approach.  For example, Faust in Guilty Gear Xrd can FDC his air drill attack. This attack would normally send him back towards the ground, but when FDCed, it stops the upward momentum of his jump he can immediately attack with an air normal. This is such a common strategy for Faust that people call this a ""Drill Cancel"". You can also FD Cancel while running forward; you might hear this called FD Brake, since it stops your run momentum immediately."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Footsies,"A complicated, often nebulous term that refers to the battle for controlling the space in front of you, often by using good pokes. In essence, you are trying to get to a range you like, while trying to deny your opponent getting to a range that they like. How you do this varies wildly based on the game, but it often involves using strong crouching kick attacks to pester your opponent as they are trying to walk around. This dance of playing mind games with your feet is the source of the term's name.  In reality, footsies can mean different things to different people, and often combines lots of adjacent concepts. Some people think that footsies needs to be a grounded affair, between characters that don't jump and fight for space only by walking. While this is a good example, I think applying the term narrow-mindedly to only these situations is falling out of favor. As more people play more diverse fighting games, they are realizing that you get the ""feel"" of footsies in lots of different ways, and this battle for space can extend to the air, or to movement options beyond walking, quite easily. That said, using amazing footsies to perform an awesome whiff punish will never fall out of style."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Flash Kick,"An invincible charge move made famous from Guile in Street Fighter. Hold down, or down-back, for about a second and then hit up plus a kick button to fly into the air foot first. It's a very common reversal and anti-air, but because it's a charge move, it needs more planning to use than a dragon punch. The term ""flash kick"" itself extends into other games too, as it's common to use it to describe any down-up charge move that can be used in this way."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Floor Break,"Punching someone through the floor, falling to the level below. Only a few Tekken stages will have destructible floors, so this is less common than the wall break or the balcony break, but if you do land one, you'll be able to continue the combo when you both land on the stage below. As with all Tekken ""breaks"", only certain moves can trigger a floor break."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fierce,Another name for heavy punch. It's the most satisfying alternate name for a normal attack. Even just hearing the word makes you want to press the button.
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Floaty,"A character that does not fall very fast towards the stage. A common strength of floaty characters, like Jigglypuff for example, is that they can use their floatiness to be deceptive in the air, drifting in and out of range and maybe even attacking multiple times before landing. This is the opposite of being a fast-faller."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Force Stand,"When an attack forces a crouching opponent to stand up when it hits them. This is particularly useful when a follow-up combo does not work against a crouching opponent. Including an attack that ""forces stand"" in the combo will make sure the opponent is no longer crouching and that the rest of the combo works fine."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,FD Brake,"A Guilty Gear technique that lets you stop your forward run animation and block immediately. If you hold down-back after you start running, normally you have to skid to a stop, and you can't block at all while this is happening. Instead, if you briefly tap Faultless Defense (a.k.a. FD) while holding down-back, you'll immediately stop the run without sliding, allowing you to block much sooner.  You don't have to hold FD, a simple tap and release will do â€” although, if you want to continue to use Faultless Defense on your opponent's offense, you can choose to hold it down if you like. Using FD brake to approach your opponent is much safer than the alternative, and you should get used to doing it often!   You might also hear this called ""dash brake"", since you are putting the brakes on your dash. This more general term may apply to some other non-Guilty Gear games if there are mechanics in place that let you cancel a dash or air dash."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Frame Trap,"Two attacks back-to-back that leave a very small gap between them. The gap will be shorter than the defender's fastest attack, which means if they try to attack with a normal, they will get counter hit. Finding effective frame traps requires some basic understanding of frame data (or finding a good Youtube tutorial that has done the work for you!); you'll usually be looking for an attack that is plus on block, which lets you attack before your opponent afterwards, then swinging with a fast attack that ""traps"" your opponent who foolishly thought they could swing themselves.  Frame traps aren't foolproof, though. You can usually just continue to block and be fine until your opponent gets pushed out of range. Or, if you're feeling risky, you can try to get through the opponent's attack with an invincible reversal, which doesn't care about your opponent's pesky frame advantage."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fireball,"A specific type of projectile that travels horizontally and is traditionally input using a quarter circle command. Ryu, Sagat, Jago and Sol all throw fireballs, and they are perhaps the most iconic special moves in all of fighting games. Beams that travel the whole screen instantly and Sonic Booms that require a charge motion aren't usually called fireballs. ""Fireball"" can even be used as shorthand for ""quarter circle forward"", if you're trying to quickly describe a special move input. ""The input for your command dash is fireball + kick"" would be a valid sentence, for example."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Forward,"Another name for medium kick. ""Low forward"" means crouching medium kick and is a common phrase you'll hear in Street Fighter games. And, of course, it could also mean holding forward on the analog stick. Yes, that means if you want to talk about a command normal that uses medium kick while holding the forward direction, you might have to parse the phrase ""forward forward"" at some point."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Frame Kill,"Whiffing attacks on purpose in order to very specifically time another attack. Let's say that, after you've knocked down your opponent, you want to try to perform a safe jump. But if you were to jump immediately, you'd be too early and your opponent would still be knocked down. After a bit of clever math and the help of some frame data, you realize you need to wait for 17 frames and then the timing will be perfect.  One option is to just try and get a sense for what 17 frames ""feels like"" and time it manually, but this is pretty difficult so people quickly tried to find something more reliable. For example, if you know that one of your moves takes exactly 17 frames to execute from start to finish, this is way better â€” simply whiff that move and you'll have ""killed"" those 17 frames perfectly with no need for guesswork or eyeballing anything. If you see people whiffing moves nonsensically when their opponent is knocked down, they're almost certainly setting up the timing for a future attack."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Flipout,"Hitting someone out of the air so that they flip and land on their feet, rather than landing on their back with a knockdown. Each game handles its aerial hits differently; in some games, every aerial hit automatically causes a flipout, while in some games flipout doesn't exist at all, and every aerial hit ends in a knockdown.  Most games, though, will have some moves specifically marked as able to flip out and others marked as knockdown. Flipouts can lead to powerful mixups (usually called air resets) where you walk under the opponent as they're falling, and then as soon as they land, you force them to guess what side you'll end up on. This is very similar to a cross-up, but people will call it a ""cross-under"" in these situations."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Five Gods,"A term of respect used to refer to five legendary Japanese fighting game players: Daigo, Tokido, Nuki, sako, and Haitani. All five of these players have been dominant in multiple fighting games dating back to the 1990s; the moniker started to gain prominence when they were competing to be the strongest in Vampire Savior, a 1997 Capcom title. Even more impressively, all five players are still active (and dominating) into the 2020s.  Interestingly, Smash Bros. Melee has its own set of Five Gods: Armada, mang0, Mew2King, Hungrybox, and PPMD. From 2008-2015, these players won virtually every single tournament they entered, basically only ever losing to each other during that stretch. And while some of these players have retired from competitive play, many of them are still big tournament threats into the 2020s, which is a remarkable feat of longevity in such a technically demanding game."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Force Function,"A unique ability for each character in Under Night In-Birth, done by pressing B+C. Depending on the character, it might be an attack, a throw, a new movement option, a dodge, or something else entirely. Force Functions are powerful, so they will cost you one square of your GRD gauge to use (or, if you don't have any GRD, it will build one square for your opponent). It's best to think of them like a cool special move that isn't mapped to a motion command, a bit like Street Fighter V's V-Skill."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Frame,"A unit used to measure time in a fighting game. Most fighting games operate at 60 frames per second, which means one frame is 1/60th of a second, or about 16 milliseconds, and you can't break this unit down any further. A frame is the core unit used in frame data, which measures the properties of moves in a fighting game, such as how long they take to execute, or which character gets to act first if a move is blocked.  Some players, especially beginners, get intimidated when the word ""frame"" comes up, as if it's some arcane magic. If this is you, instead try to think of a frame as a relative unit. Let's say move A starts up in 3 frames and move B starts up in 4 frames. You might think why do we care about a 16 millisecond difference? There's no way to visually tell the difference between these... and you'd be absolutely right! Don't think of it that way. Instead, think that move B is ""1 frame slower"" than move A, so in situations where both fighters get to attack at the same time, move A is going to hit first. Imagine it as a way to compare two moves, rather than something you're supposed to notice visually, and you'll find yourself making sense of it more quickly."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fireball War,"Two players throwing lots of fireballs at each other, often without moving, while daring the other person to jump first. A lot of beginners will crack after throwing just one or two fireballs, while expert players can sit there chucking plasma for a long time without feeling the heat, knowing they will have good reactions to anti-air when the time comes. Subtle variations in timing, spacing, and strength of the fireballs used can make these battles fun and interesting, even if they look like boring spam to your average joe."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fatality,"A violent finishing attack you can perform after you have won a game in Mortal Kombat. Even if you don't play fighting games, it's pretty likely that you know what a Fatality is, as they have been well known in the videogame landscape for 25 years. There have been tweaks on the formula over the years, including the Babality and the Friendship."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Faultless Defense,"A defensive mechanic in the Guilty Gear series that lets you spend your Tension gauge (a.k.a., super meter) in exchange for a stronger block. Commonly called ""FD"". While blocking and holding two buttons, your character gets a green bubble around them and will continuously spend Tension, but you will prevent chip damage, be able to block certain normally unblockable attacks while in the air, your RISC gauge will not increase, and your opponent will get pushed away faster, giving you more room to breathe.  It's not a perfect solution to all problems, though. You will be stuck in block stun for slightly longer (2 frames) when you FD, so you won't want to FD every attack all the time. Overall though, FD is a powerful use of your Tension that has lots of applications, including creative ones like FD Brake, and is very common to see at high level play. In Guilty Gear Strive, you can Instant Block and FD at the same time for even more pushback; you'll hear this called IFD (for Instant Faultless Defense) or other similar abbreviations. BlazBlue has a very similar mechanic called Barrier Block."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Frame Data,"A complete list of the inner workings of every move in a fighting game. Pretty much everything will be measured with frames, a fighting game's fundamental building block of time. You can learn the startup, active, and recovery frames of each move, what the frame advantage is when the move hits or is blocked, how much damage each move does, and any other special properties the move might have, like hitting overhead or low.  Frame data can intimidate people, because it's a giant spreadsheet that looks pretty overwhelming. But, really, frame data is not intended to be memorized like a list of formulas for your high school math class. The two most important numbers are the startup of a move (""how fast is it?"") and how safe or unsafe the move is if it gets blocked (""how risky is it to use?""). When you're getting started with frame data, you can generally skip all the other numbers and focus on these. Look for fast moves, and safe moves, then try these out in matches and see how you do! Then, when you get more practice with the game, the other numbers will make more sense naturally."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Float,"Hitting your Tekken opponent into the air in a way that doesn't involve using a launcher. For example, if you catch your opponent jumping and hit them with a quick attack, you will float them and can follow up with a combo almost as if you had launched them. There are other ways you can float your opponent, depending on which version of Tekken you're playing, so look out for them and capitalize with big damage."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Footstool,"Jumping off someone's head, using them as a springboard and sending them downwards. As soon as you are right above your opponent's head, simply press jump and bounce off their head.  This technique was first introduced in Smash Bros. Brawl and has been in every Smash game since. People have found creative uses of footstooling in combos and during edge-guarding, particularly for gimps, but it's a little tough to use properly since you will not be able to footstool someone downwards if they are doing an attack."
F,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=F,Fast Fall,"Pressing down while in the air to instantly accelerate to your character's maximum falling speed. Attacking after a fast fall is a crucial skill in Smash Bros. Melee, since it lets many characters perform several powerful aerial attacks in rapid succession, hitting the ground between each one. It's part of the core of SHFFLing."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gimp,"Intercepting a character who is trying to recover back to the stage and killing them, usually with a weak attack or technique not meant to deliver powerful knockback. The general goal is to interfere with their preferred method of recovery so they are at risk of dying at low percentages. Maybe you will knock Donkey Kong downwards so his mostly-horizontal recovery doesn't have the height to get back on the stage, or maybe you will try to absorb Ness's PK Thunder so he falls helplessly to his death. Early gimps can cause huge momentum swings in a match, so be careful."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gravity Scaling,"A game mechanic in some anime games where the opponent in a prolonged air combo or being juggled will start to fall towards the ground faster as the combo gets longer. Eventually, the character gets too heavy and will thunk to the ground faster than the opponent can attack, ending the combo. It's one way to prevent infinite combos."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Grab,"See throw. ""Throw"" tends to be the more common term for regular throws, but ""command grab"" tends to be more popular for special move throws. Don't worry about it too much though, both are fine."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gap,"How long your character has returned to neutral in between blocking (or getting hit by) two attacks. Like all discussions of time in fighting games, it's measured in frames. While you're in neutral, you can take any action, but be careful! If you are only in neutral for a few brief frames, there are some actions you won't want to take, especially if your opponent is looking to do a frame trap.  If your character blocks two attacks and there is no gap at all, we'll call that a true block string or say the offense is tight (it's also quite related to the Tekken concept of jailing). Sometimes players will just ask ""is there a gap in that string?"" just so they know whether they even have the option to do anything except block. Maybe if there's a gap they'll sometimes try a reversal to escape."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Guard,An alternate term for blocking. Japanese players will always refer to blocking as guarding.
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gouki,"The Japanese name for Akuma. Like with Vega, M. Bison and Balrog, there are some naming differences between some characters in the Japanese and English versions."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Game,"A collection of rounds after which a winner will be decided. In most fighters, a game is decided after a player wins 2 rounds, but in some other fighters such as Tekken, it is more common to win 3 rounds. In fighting games with multiple health bars, such as Killer Instinct and the Marvel vs. Capcom series, a game ends after all health bars for one player have been depleted."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Getup,"A set of system-wide actions you can take in Mortal Kombat 11 as you are waking up. You can do a ""Getup Attack"", which is effectively a reversal attack; this costs 1 Defensive Meter and 1 Offensive Meter and you can pick between an invincible but low damage attack, or an attack that starts a combo but isn't invincible. You can also tech roll either backwards or forwards for just 1 Defensive Meter, although like most rolls, this can be thrown if your opponent predicts it. You can also do a Delayed Getup (for free), which keeps your back on the ground a little longer and might mess up your opponent's attack timing."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Groove,"A set of mechanics you apply to your team in Capcom vs. SNK 2. When you pick your characters, you also pick one of six ""grooves"" (similar to ISMs in an older game), which apply different universal mechanics and playstyles to your team. Since it's a crossover game, three of the grooves (C, A, and P) approximate systems from Capcom games, and the other three (S, N, and K) approximate systems from SNK games.  C-Groove: Uses a more traditional super meter, giving access to level 1, 2, and 3 supers. Probably the second-strongest groove. A-Groove: A custom combo groove that allows for huge damage and nasty tricks. The strongest groove. P-Groove: Has access to a parry and one long super meter. Situationally decent but not used too often. S-Groove: Gives access to an in-place spot dodge, has super meter that is manually chargeable, and unlimited level 1 supers when you are low on life. Despite that, the worst groove in the game. N-Groove: Has three ""stocks"" of super meter, where one can be spent to charge your character up. Not the best, not the worst groove. K-Groove: Has just defend and a rage meter that charges up when you take damage for a very powerful super attack. Probably the best SNK groove.  It's worth noting that you can execute the incredibly powerful roll cancel technique only in C, A, and N grooves, which is one of the main reasons C and A are so lopsidedly strong."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,G-Cancel,"A way for you to stop inputting your current string in Virtua Fighter and start inputting a new one from the beginning. To do this, simply press G any time you're attacking to ""clear"" the game's memory of your current string; because of that, you'll also hear this called G-Clearing.  As an example, let's say that you want to hit neutral punch (P), and then neutral punch again as soon as the first attack is over. This is difficult, because the large input buffer in Virtua Fighter will always try to give you your character's unique 2-hit PP string instead. Instead, hit G after the first P to perform a G-Cancel. You won't see any guard animation, but your second P will now be treated as if it was pressed in neutral, allowing you to ""start over"" with a new string whenever you want. G-Canceling is a crucial tool for inputting certain juggle combos that need to deftly avoid getting the wrong string."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gauge,"Mostly synonymous with meter. Basically, it's the physical on-screen representation of how much of some resource you have (for example, a measure of how much super meter you have). You'll hear this called your ""meter"", ""super meter"", or ""super gauge"" kind of interchangeably. Meter is the much more common English term, while gauge is used in Japanese."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gougi,"A system in Fighting EX Layer that lets you choose a set of 5 rule-breaking buffs to your character. Each buff individually triggers after you have met some condition in the middle of the match (like, attacking your opponent 10 times, or using a set amount of super meter). Some of the benefits are relatively mild, like increasing your super meter gain by 10% for the rest of the match, while others can be absolutely wild, like gain permanent hyper armor on everything, freely cancel blocking into any special or super move, or turning invisible every time you dash. You can't freely customize your Gougi, though, you must choose one of the preset ""decks"" containing 5 buffs and use that."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Genei Jin,"An install super for Yun in the Street Fighter series. I'll be talking about the version in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, which is notably one of the most powerful supers in fighting game history. Yun activates a special custom combo mode that lets him cancel attacks together repeatedly, gain huge frame advantage on all his attacks, and string together long juggle combos that can do huge damage. In addition, the length of the super gauge is short, which means it is quite common for Yun to finish one activation and use it again only a few seconds later.  The super is so powerful that building meter for Genei Jin is Yun's plan for the start, middle, and end of every round. When he doesn't have the meter, he will often run away and build meter safely from a distance so he can activate it and charge in. When he does have meter, he will create virtually inescapable mixups involving strikes and command grabs, deal damage, then repeat the process. Despite how degenerate Genei Jin is, using it effectively takes quite a bit of practice and experience (especially for things like the daipan loop), so you'd best get to training."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gold Throw,"A throw that you attempt while your opponent is in block stun, or has very recently left block stun. Several gold rings will appear around the opponent to indicate this ""worse"" version of a throw. Gold throws allow for considerably longer throw tech windows, making teching these throws possible to tech on reaction, and therefore making tick throws in Under Night quite a bit less valuable. BlazBlue has a very similar mechanic, and the indicator in that game is purple exclamation marks over your head, so it's called a Purple Throw there."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,GRD,"A wholly unique system mechanic in the Under Night In-Birth series, representing a mini tug-of-war between the two players several times per round. In the bottom middle of the screen, you will see a GRD gauge (pronounced ""grid""), with six squares for each player, meeting at a circular timer in the middle. As the players fight, they will fill (and lose) squares on this meter by taking specific actions. For example, you can earn GRD meter by blocking (or shielding) and landing hits, so playing aggressively and defending correctly are rewarded. You lose GRD meter by actions like backdashing, taking hits, or using your Force Function.  When the timer completes a full cycle every 16.5 seconds, the person with more squares filled will ""win"" the cycle. They will enter a state called Vorpal, which grants them a damage boost and some other important benefits (like Chain Shift) for the entirety of the next cycle.  The cool thing about GRD is that it changes the risk and reward for mechanics in a very interesting way. If the timer is about to finish its cycle, you may stop attacking a blocking opponent, because you are filling their GRD meter and you don't want to help them win Vorpal. A smart opponent will recognize this, know you are going to stop attacking, and do something really bold like run up and throw you. GRD gives Under Night an extremely unique flavor that isn't in any other fighting game."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Guard Meter,"A gauge that fills up as you block attacks, and begins to decrease if you do not block for a set amount of time. It's common in some older Street Fighter titles, as well as the King of Fighters series. If your guard meter fills up to its maximum value, you'll get guard crushed and the sweet embrace of death will often not be far behind."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gatling,"A Guilty Gear term that just means canceling a normal attack into another normal attack. These are often called chains, strings, or target combos in other games, and the concept is pretty much the same here. How gatlings work depend on which version of Guilty Gear you're playing; in some games you can mostly cancel any attack into any other attack of equal or higher strength, whereas in a game like Guilty Gear Strive, you're more limited to only certain cancels."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Guard Impact,"A classic Soulcalibur mechanic that lets you parry incoming enemy attacks, pushing your enemy back and usually allowing a punish. While the enemy is reeling, though, they can always input a Guard Impact of their own, trying to start a GI war until someone outsmarts the other.  A staple of the franchise, it's been implemented a few different ways over the years. In Soulcalibur VI, your opponent will get knocked back in three different ways, depending on what ""type"" of attack you parried (usually, the fastest attacks cause the most forceful knockback and allow the biggest punish). You can't GI Break Attacks, which act as a kind of armor breaker unless you also spend some super meter (if you do spend the bar, this is called a Resist Impact or Red Impact). Guard Impacts can whiff if your opponent doesn't attack, so be careful."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,GRD Break,"A state where you're unable to earn any GRD gauge or use any of the systems that require the D button (including Assault and Shield). You can become GRD broken in a number of ways, but the most common way is if you get hit or thrown while trying to Shield. Other ways include getting hit by your opponent's Veil Off, using a defensive Guard Thrust, or launching your massive Infinite Worth EXS super attack.  Being GRD broken sucks. Not only are you less effective in battle, being unable to Shield or use movement options like Assault, but you can't win the GRD cycle while you are broken, basically handing Vorpal to your opponent. You'll be GRD broken for a set amount of time shown next to your GRD gauge. You can speed this timer up by blocking attacks, or clear it to 0 immediately by using Veil Off."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Ground Bounce,"Bouncing your opponent off the ground, rather than knocking them down. It's pretty common in team games as a stylish way to keep a combo going. Like wall bounces, you usually only get to do it once per combo."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gimmick,"A plan of attack that requires either the element of surprise or a lack of knowledge from your opponent to work. The term is often meant in a negative way towards a strategy that wouldn't possibly work against well-prepared opponents, or something that can only work in the short term until your opponent understands the trick.  The term can also refer to a player who uses one linear but mostly effective strategy to beat lower skilled opponents, but who loses convincingly, with no backup strategy, when playing against better players who can defend properly. It may sound like gimmicks are kinda bad, but there's no better feeling in fighting games than to hit someone with a good one."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Grappler,"A character whose primary offensive tools are throws and command throws. Grapplers usually move and jump slowly and fight poorly from long distances, but are terrifying when they get close to their opponent and apply their very strong throw-based mixups. Examples include Zangief from Street Fighter and Potemkin from Guilty Gear.  A character that frequently uses command throws, but has better ways to move around the screen than traditional grapplers, are sometimes called ""hybrid"" or ""pseudo""-grapplers. Grappler players live for that one moment when they can get close and win back all the damage they took trying to close the gap."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Guard Crush,"A game mechanic where blocking too many attacks in a short period of time will shatter your defense and leave you wide open to a big attack or combo starter. How close you are to disaster is usually measured by a guard meter. In general, guard crush gives another reason for players to not try to block forever, and instead encourage them to attack back or move out of the way. Guard Crush, or variations on the mechanic, have been in Street Fighter, King of Fighters, Soulcalibur, and many other titles. The Guilty Gear series has its own unique take on a guard crush mechanic through something called RISC.  In some games, notably Marvel vs. Capcom titles and Melty Blood, ""guard crush"" can refer to simply hitting with an unblockable (as in, the unblockable defeats their guard). This often comes up when you make them block something first, then hit them with an unblockable while they are trapped in block stun (for example, hitting an airborne opponent with a grounded normal while they are trapped blocking something else, like a projectile)."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,GTE,"A Virtua Fighter acronym that means ""guard throw escape"". As explained in the VF notation entry, this is a defensive option select that means ""guard for a brief window, then try to input throw escape"", which lets you defend against many attacks and throws with the same set of inputs. You'll also hear this called a ""lazy tech"" or ""yutori defense"", and it's very similar to delayed teching in many 2D games. It's a super common defensive tool for VF players."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Green Shield,"Performing a shield in Under Night In-Birth while already in block stun from a previous attack. Instead of the ""standard"" blue shield you get from neutral, your shield will be green and it will behave a little differently.  Unlike normal shield, you cannot hold a green shield for as long as you like; instead, tapping the D button will make the green shield active for 15 frames. As a bonus for even trying a green shield, you'll immediately generate a fair bit of pushback (think along the lines of Guilty Gear's Faultless Defense). Then, if an attack hits you while the green shield is up, cool! You get all the benefits of a normal shield, like being put in less block stun which may let you punish something that's normally safe, and negating chip damage.  It's not free to attempt a green shield though. All green shields cost a small amount of super meter to try, and if they don't attack you while your green shield is up, you will lose a block of GRD as an extra penalty. And of course, if you get thrown or hit while trying to green shield, you get GRD broken just like regular shield.  Green shield is pretty important for UNI defense, though. If someone is doing a long block string on you, you can green shield in the middle to push them far away, and if they keep attacking, they'll probably whiff an attack and you can punish! This will force them to mix up their string options, perhaps adding some delays to bait green shield, trying to force you to lose GRD unnecessarily. Then you might be able to escape some other way! This give and take makes up a large part of how pressure works in UNI."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Grappler Jump,"Doing an empty jump from a specific range with a slow moving character with big air attacks (usually a grappler). Grapplers tend to have a hard time approaching, so they're given beefy air moves to make jumping scary. You, as the defender, should rightly be trying to anti-air them. However, if a grappler finds the sweet spot where a forward jump would hit with the tip of one of these air attacks, you're in trouble; if they empty jump instead, your anti-air will probably be out of range and you'll whiff, leading to a big punish.  If you ever see a match between two skilled players, watch for how often the grappler gets to jump forward and press an air attack without being anti-aired. The fear of a potential empty jump causing whiffs is the reason why. The alternative of simply not trying to anti-air is even worse, though. You don't want grappler players getting free approaches."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Gorilla,"A character who wants to get in your face by whatever means necessary and start swinging wildly, knowing that whatever move they randomly choose will be very hard to stop. Gorillas tend to not care about trifling things like ""thinking"" or ""playing neutral""... no, they're going to do some full screen move that is unnecessarily hard to punish and then do something wild that seems to always hit you. Gorillas can be very fun to play, but also very frustrating to play against. Playing solid against them can work, but sometimes you just need to try and match their level of crazy instead."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,GGPO,"An abbreviation of ""good game, peace out"". While the term started as a phrase said to your opponent after finishing a session, it's now known primarily as the abbreviation for software that helps developers implement rollback netcode into their games. The terms ""rollback"" and ""GGPO"" are kinda interchangeable for this reason, even though you can code your own rollback solution without using the GGPO branded middleware.  GGPO is now free to use under the MIT license, and you can read more about it and download its open-source code on the GGPO website."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Glass Cannon,"A character that has very low health, but a ton of exceptional tools for movement, offense, damage, and often defense too. They're kind of an ""all or nothing"" character; you have all the tools necessary to implement lots of different gameplans and do huge grips of damage if you land a hit, but if you make a mistake and get touched yourself, you might explode.  Glass cannons usually end up being strong characters, but like their related cousins, the pixies, they can be very stressful to play in tournament since you are on the knife's edge in every match. Examples include Mira from Killer Instinct, Akuma from many Street Fighter titles, and Phoenix from Marvel vs. Capcom 3."
G,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=G,Guard Cancel,"A technique in the King of Fighters series that lets you take an action while blocking for 1 bar of super meter. You can either roll forward or backward by pressing a direction with the A+B buttons (called Guard Cancel Roll), or you can perform an attack that knocks the opponent away by pressing C+D (called Guard Cancel Blowback). Since you can abbreviate Guard Cancel to GC, you'll see this called lots of things, like GC Roll or GCAB, referring to the buttons pressed. The Blowback attack is a common mechanic in many games, similar to things like Alpha Counters and V-Reversals.  You may also hear this term used in other fighting games to talk about any defensive move done out of block stun. Much like ""Alpha Counter"", it's taken on kind of a generic, catch-all meaning for this general class of technique, and you can ask questions like ""does this game have a guard cancel?"" pretty safely."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Heat,"A powered-up state you can enter in Melty Blood. While in Heat, your super meter will turn into a timer and tick down to zero and you'll be able to perform EX moves at a reduced cost (similar to Under Night's Veil Off mechanic). Importantly, you'll also start healing the recoverable life accrued from past attacks, making it an important method to prolong your health bar. There's also a slightly more powerful version called Blood Heat.  In Melty Blood: Type Lumina, you can activate Heat manually by pressing A+B+C any time after you've earned 1 gauge of super meter. The game officially calls activating Heat ""Forced Release"", but don't worry about this, since everybody will just say Heat instead. You can turn  Heat on in neutral, or while you're blocking as a sort of ""get off me"" move. This activation is both invincible and unblockable (although you can shield it), but it's got short range and if it whiffs, you're going to get punished. You can use your Arc Drive any time while Heat is active, but you'll drain the rest of your time.  In Melty Blood: AACC, Heat changes depending on what Moon you've selected. Crescent Moon works largely the same as Type Lumina's Heat mode; it is the only Moon that can manually activate Heat without needing full super meter. The other two Moons must fill their super gauge all the way before Heat is an option. In Half Moon, you'll automatically enter Heat at this time (sometimes called ""Auto-Heat""). In Full Moon, you'll first enter MAX mode at full gauge, which starts to drain your super meter. You can now enter Heat by performing a powerful Roman Cancel-like technique called Initiative Heat, or just pop your Blood Heat raw instead."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Hajiki Screw,"A specific hand motion for executing 360s very quickly on an arcade stick. One way to do this is to hold right on the stick, pinch the ball of the stick between your thumb and index finger, and then ""snap"" or ""flick"" the stick down with your thumb. The momentum will carry the stick all the way around to the up direction (without touching your hand again), giving you enough inputs to complete the 360 incredibly fast. The namesake comes from Screw Piledriver, which is the Japanese name for an SPD.  You don't need to learn how to do a Hajiki Screw to do SPDs without jumping, and many good grappler players do not use the technique. It's more common if you play older games, like Super SF2 Turbo, since the speed of a Hajiki Screw lets you more consistently whiff punish attacks with Zangief or T.Hawk's SPDs, making you even scarier."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Health Bar,"A visual representation of your character's life points. Taking damage will lose health points, and if your health bar reaches the end, you will lose the round. You should be pretty used to health bars if you've played any video game in the last twenty years."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Half Circle,"A motion used to input many common special moves that starts with the joystick at left or right, and moves in a semi-circle motion to the other side. The version towards your opponent is 41236 in numpad notation and is commonly abbreviated HCF for ""half circle forward"".  Similarly, 63214 is called HCB for ""half circle back"". Half circles are somewhat common as inputs in fighting games, but there is no famous half circle move that is often used as a shortcut name, like ""fireball"" might be for the quarter circle.  It's also common for games to have a shortcut for the motion which lets you start at down-back or down-forward, just to make it easier to do from a crouching position. You might think this is getting awfully close to a quarter circle input, so why not just use that command instead? And, well... lots of games would agree with you, as the half circle is falling out of favor in several modern titles."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Hard-to-Blockable,"A nonsensical combination of words meant to convey a situation that is almost an unblockable, but can be defended through extremely precise blocking (often changing your blocking direction as a just frame input). For example, in games with unblockable protection, instead of overlapping an overhead and a low attack on the same frame, you might try to offset one or the other by a frame or two, forcing the defender to guess which attack is coming first and then rapidly switch their blocking direction to cover the other. While these sequences are ""technically"" humanly blockable, they are so difficult that they are often effectively unblockable, hence this hodgepodge word soup of a term."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Heavy Kick,"One of the six attack buttons in a 6-button fighter. Commonly abbreviated as HK or called roundhouse. Heavy kicks have slow startup, but are often high damage and cover good space. Crouching heavy kicks, called sweeps, usually hit low and knock down. Jumping heavy kick followed by crouching heavy kick was the first combo you found in your first Street Fighter game, and many people still don't use better combos decades later."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,HD Mode,"A unique custom combo install mode in King of Fighters XIII. When your Drive Gauge (the green bar above your super meter) is full, press LK + HP to activate Hyper Drive (HD) mode. While it is active, all of your normals now become cancelable into specials or supers, even if they weren't before. Drive Cancels become much cheaper, letting you string together long freeform combos. And lastly, you can cancel a Desperation Move directly into a Neo Max (called a ""Max Cancel"") for huge damage and at a cheaper cost than doing the moves individually."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Happy Birthday,"Hitting two characters at the same time in a team game. This usually happens because someone tried to call an assist but got hit immediately, and the assist gets caught up in the mayhem and has to go along for the ride too. In games like Marvel vs. Capcom 3, you can usually kill both characters if you recognize what's happening (especially if you have X-Factor available). The term comes from the wonderful, gracious gift your opponent gives you by making a bad assist call, although it's not quite as festive as saying Merry Christmas."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Hadouken,"The specific name for Ryu and Ken's fireballs in the Street Fighter series, but it can be used to talk about any generic, forward-traveling projectile that is not a charge move."
H,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=H,Hard Knockdown,"A specific type of knockdown where the time you spend on the ground is set in stone and you typically do not have any extra options (like rolling) to choose from when you are waking up. This is in contrast to a soft knockdown, where you can choose to rise faster if you like. Hard knockdowns are typically a property of the move; for example, in Street Fighter IV, all successful sweeps earn a hard knockdown, but each game will have their own rules here.  They tend to lead to the scariest mixups and set play, since the offensive player has lots of time to launch any strategy they like, and they know exactly when you will be rising from the ground so there's not much you can do to trick them. Try not to get hit by these if you can!"
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Infinite Prevention System,"A Skullgirls system that, as you might have guessed, is designed to prevent infinite combos. In Skullgirls, your combos are built off repeated chains, separated by air attacks and special moves. After a certain number of hits, the game keeps track of which normals you use in your combo, and if you ever start a chain with a normal you've previously used, the game lets the opponent burst and escape for free.  The idea is to force the opponent to vary the combo (thus, making sure it is not an infinite loop of the same sequence), but in practice, many combos just killed before the IPS made any difference. In the end, Skullgirls implemented a second system called Undizzy to help keep combos shorter."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Incoming,"When your opponent's character in a team game is forced to come on screen while you are free to act. This happens in one of two main ways: from a snapback, or when your opponent's point character dies and the next character in line must jump into the fight.  In games like Marvel vs. Capcom, the mixups you can generate ""on incoming"" are some of the strongest, most difficult to block sequences in all of fighting games. It's a very scary part of the fight and if you can survive the incoming, you'll be in good shape. Some games try to remove the incoming mixup, like Dragon Ball FighterZ, which resets to a ""round start"" position each time a character is defeated. But you still have to worry about being snapped, so no matter how hard you try, people will find ways to make incoming scary."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Infinite Worth,"A powerful super attack in the Under Night In-Birth series. Usually abbreviated to IW, they take your entire EXS gauge to use, and the command is universally half circle forward + D for all characters. There's also a more powerful version called Infinite Worth EXS."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Impact Frame,"A specific way to talk about a move's startup. If a move has 7 frames of non-hitting startup, and then has its first active frame on frame 8, you'll often see this notated as ""i8"" to indicate that the move can first make impact with its opponent on frame 8. This notation is common in Tekken, but you'll also hear ""impact frame"" used in Super Smash Bros. from time to time."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Increase,"The Under Night In-Birth term for charging up certain specific attacks by holding the button down. You'll add extra properties to the move, like more damage, extra frame advantage, or many other move-specific quirks. A lot of heavy normals and Force Functions in UNI have Increase versions, and you'll find them denoted with square brackets, like 5[C]. Melty Blood has a very similar mechanic to this called ""Blowback Edge""."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,IASA,"A term commonly used in Super Smash Bros. to indicate when an attack's recovery can be interrupted with another action before it's complete. Stands for ""interruptible as soon as"", and often comes with a frame number after. It's also commonly called FAF, which stands for ""first actionable frame"".  For example, a move may take 50 total frames (including startup, active and recovery) to complete, but if it is ""IASA frame 40"" or ""has a FAF of 40"", then that means you can end the move early and do anything you want on the 40th frame or later. If you've seen Street Fighter V's supers, where characters often do some long pose after their super is complete but it can be ""skipped"" during matches by players moving early, it's the same idea."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Infinite Combo,"A combo that can continue forever in theory, but in practice will end because either the clock or your opponent's health will run out. Infinite combos are generally seen as a poor design choice, and most games try to prevent infinites through various means, including hit stun deterioration, gravity scaling, juggle potential, or game-specific approaches like Killer Instinct's KV meter. Most infinite combos involve looping a sequence of moves over and over, and in modern games typically require a convoluted setup or a bug to trick the game into letting it happen.  Infinite combos have a long and contentious history; most people consider it cheap and frustrating, but a surprising number of popular games have had their best strategies shaped by unintended infinite combos, including Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Street Fighter Alpha 3 (with Crouch Cancel Infinites), Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 (with TAC Infinites), and many kusoge, perhaps most famously Hokuto No Ken."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Infinite,"Usually refers to an infinite combo. You might also see it used sarcastically, like ""got him in the infinite""; this is when a bad player constantly gets hit by an easily avoidable technique many times in a row. If this happens to you, give blocking a try."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Inashi,"A move that will catch (certain) incoming attacks, then push your opponent away, leaving you very plus. You'll be able to start offensive pressure with your frame advantage, or in some cases, maybe even get a guaranteed combo.  Basically, an inashi is a reversal (the 3D game catch counter kind), but without the automatic follow-up attack. Instead of knocking your opponent down, an inashi leaves them standing up, so they're susceptible to different kinds of pressure. The inashi tends to be the rarest of the three ""I know you're going to attack, so check this out"" techniques in Virtua Fighter, with the most common being Aoi's ""Tenchi In'you"" command. The other two techniques are the reversal and the sabaki."
I,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=I,Imbalance,"Poor balance. The game might not be all the way to broken, but maybe the strong characters are way better than the weak characters, or some other strategy is just so good that it dominates play."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Jump Test,"A quick and dirty way to get a sense of how plus or minus on block an attack is. In training mode, pick the same character for both P1 and P2. Then, record the dummy character to do the move you're testing, and then hold up for a few seconds after. Lastly, take control of the first character, block the move in question, and then hold up yourself.  If the dummy character (that is, the attacker) jumps first, your attack is plus. If you (the defender) jump first, your attack is minus. You won't really know the exact number, but you can usually get a sense of whether it's plus by ""a lot"" or ""a little"" very quickly, and that's often enough to make a rough gameplan.  Of course, if your game has frame data built into training mode, you don't always need to do this method, but not all games have that, and you might also want to test some meaty situations where the frame data gets altered a bit. Fun fact: when fans want to verify the frame data for a game, one method is to record video of a jump test of the attack, then study the frame-by-frame footage using video software to get the exact number!"
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Jab,"Another name for light punch. This one is pretty common and easy to understand. You might also hear this called ""One Jab"" in a game like Tekken, based on Tekken's notation using 1 for a left punch. They're super fast check moves you can use to keep your opponent off balance. You might also hear ""dick jab"" to refer to a crouching jab, typically in 3D games. I probably don't need to explain that one."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Juggle,"The act of comboing an airborne opponent while you are on the ground. Moves that work well in juggles tend to launch the opponent high into the air and keep them close to the offensive player, so they can be hit again as they fall to the ground. As with a lot of fighting game terminology, the line between a juggle and an air combo is sometimes up for debate, so you may see the term used to describe any situation where you're comboing someone in the air."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Jail,"When you are forced to block an attack that you can normally avoid by crouching or sidestepping. You'll usually talk about a string that ""jails""; the later parts of the string might be (for example) high attacks, and if the first part whiffs, you can crouch under them like normal. However, if you end up blocking the first hit, you'll be trapped in jail and stuck blocking all of it."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Jump,"Leaping off the ground, usually by pressing up on the analog stick. If you press the up-forward or up-back directions, you will jump forwards or backwards. Some games, such as Guilty Gear or Marvel vs. Capcom titles, will allow you to block while in the air, but most fighting games have no air blocking. Jumping has a brief amount of startup, and may also have a brief amount of recovery when you land. Every character can attack with specific normals while they are jumping, and some characters also have access to airborne special moves. New players like to jump way too much, which means you can anti-air them for a lot of free damage."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Juggle Potential,"A game mechanic in some Street Fighter titles where moves that can normally be used to juggle the opponent will simply start to whiff after the combo has gone on long enough. For some games, like Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, this is implemented with a hidden timer, whereas for other games, it's based on how many times you've hit the opponent. It is one way to keep combos from being too damaging and remove the possibility of infinite combos."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Jump Install,"An advanced Guilty Gear technique that lets you access air mobility options, usually double jumping, after doing a move that is supposed to prevent you from doing them. This is common particularly in GG Accent Core and GG Xrd.  One way to do this is to cancel a grounded normal into a jump, but then before you leave the ground, do another grounded attack. You've now tricked the game into thinking you have the normal air options you'd get after a jump, even though you haven't actually jumped yet. Later in your combo, if you do something that would restrict your air options (like a super jump or a special move like Chipp's teleport), your earlier ""jump install"" takes precedence and you can now double jump! It takes a bit of practice to get used to, but jump installs can unlock cool new combo opportunities and more damage."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Jab Reset,"Knocking your opponent down in a certain way (usually because your opponent missed a tech), then hitting them with a jab (in Smash Bros., this is just your neutral A attack). If you do it right, Smash Bros. Melee will force the opponent to stand straight up off the ground, where they will have lots of recovery time and will be wide open to a huge punish.  The act of hitting your opponent while they are in this weird prone, slightly-bouncing-off-the-ground state is called a ""lock"", and each Smash game handles these locks differently. In Brawl, you could sustain the lock state more or less infinitely by constantly jabbing them or firing certain projectiles at them, and then finally force them to stand up into a free killing blow. It was basically a 0 to death combo. Smash Ultimate changes the mechanics a bit to prevent free kills, letting you optionally tech roll away after you've been jab reset out of the lock state."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,Jump Cancel,"Canceling a move with a jump. You'll just stop right in the middle of your normal or special move and immediately leave the ground. Not every game lets you do this; the ones that do tend to be high-octane team games or anime games where aerial combat is much more common than, say, Tekken or Street Fighter.  Another common application of this term is when you cancel a jump into something else before you leave the ground, usually in your pre-jump. As long as the game lets you do something during your pre-jump, your attempt to jump will stop and you'll get the grounded action instead. This is commonly how you'll do 360 motions, for instance, but depending on the game you might also transfer the throw invincibility property of your pre-jump to the new move. For example, in SFIII: 3rd Strike, you can use a ""high jump cancel"" to phase through throws while doing grounded normals or special moves."
J,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=J,John,"A Smash Bros.-specific term meaning ""excuse"". You'll hear Smash players saying ""No Johns"" to each other to remind them not to blame the game or the sun in their eyes for their loss, and to take responsibility for their gameplay and knowledge. To be honest, a lot of fighting game communities could stand to learn this lesson."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Ki Charge,"A move available to all characters in Dragon Ball FighterZ that stops them in place and starts earning super meter. It's not too easy to just use at any old random time, since you'll leave yourself wide open for a smack in the face as you're charging up, but you might be able to sneak a bit of charging in while your opponent is knocked down, or while certain assists are hitting them.  In the Tekken series, a Ki Charge is a taunt-like move that powers up your character's next attack, doing much more damage and automatically causing a counter hit. Unfortunately, you won't be able to block while you're charged up, and your opponent will also get higher damage and counter hit properties on their next attack. It's pretty uncommon to see ki charges in Tekken, apart from players trying to show off, or aggravate their opponent."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Keeper Jin,"An advanced combo for Yun in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, named after Japanese player Keeper. While in Genei Jin, Yun rapidly switches between crouching medium kick and standing heavy punch (that has been kara'ed from a standing medium punch). This combo requires very precise timing and spacing, but does quite a bit of damage and can lead to further mixups. It is also closely related to (and often mistaken for) Yun's daipan loop, which does more damage and is more commonly seen in today's 3rd Strike matches."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Kire,"A motion that combines a tiger knee input with an instant air dash input. This will let you do a very low to the ground air dash, and then instantly execute your air special move. The numpad notation for this move would be 236956, which overlaps the TK (2369) and the IAD (956). You'll hear this used mostly in Guilty Gear, and primarily to describe executing powerful air attacks like Baiken's ""Tatami Gaeshi"" special move. With a kire input, these can be performed low to the ground at high horizontal speed."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Kara Throw,"A specific type of kara cancel where the second move is a throw. In games where kara throws are possible, you'll pick a normal attack that moves your character forward a little bit during the first few frames, and then you immediately input the throw; it will feel like you're pressing the attack and the throw buttons almost simultaneously. Your character will then lurch forward suddenly and throw, greatly increasing its range.  In fact, you'll often be able to throw from way outside the opponent's throw range which, as you might guess, makes defending against throws very hard. The running joke is that Chun-Li in SFIII: 3rd Strike, a character with a super powerful kara throw, is the game's best grappler, but it certainly won't feel like much of a joke when you're playing."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,K.O.,"Draining a character's health bar to zero, causing a knockout and ending the round. Pretty much every fighting game round will end in someone getting KOed, although you will occasionally see some time out or ring out victories as well."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Knockback,"How far you get sent flying when you get hit in a platform fighter. Each move has its own base knockback value and angle, which gets amplified as you take more damage, until eventually you get launched so far you hit a blast zone and die.  In most Smash games, you can change the angle with directional influence, but not the distance you get sent. In some cases, you can prevent being knocked back by using crouch canceling. The term ""knockback"" is also used occasionally in more traditional fighters, but if you are getting hit on the ground, we tend to use the term pushback a bit more often."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Kara Cancel,"The ability to very quickly cancel a move into another move, before the first move completes its startup. Normally, in order to cancel a move, you'll have to make contact with your opponent, but kara (or ""empty"") cancels bypass that restriction and cancel immediately, often before you even see the first move on screen at all. The reason you want to do this is added range; the first move is chosen specifically because it will move your character forward during its first few frames. Then, if you quickly transition to the second move, it will be executed from this new position.  Not every game allows kara cancels, but when it does happen, it's usually the result of the game engine allowing sloppy inputs. They intentionally permit moves to cancel into other moves within the first few frames so players do not have to be incredibly precise in case they fat-finger some buttons. Depending on the game, this can have wild effects, including famous bugs like roll canceling. The most common use of kara canceling is the kara throw, but often times you can kara cancel special moves or supers as well."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Ki Blast,"A basic projectile common to most characters in Dragon Ball FighterZ. Executed with just a single button press on the ground or in the air, ki blasts are useful for basic hit and run style gameplay and to annoy your opponents from a distance. As you get better, you can even hit confirm a ki blast into a vanish and start a combo to earn some extra damage!"
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Knockdown,"Being knocked off your feet and landing on your back. Certain attacks commonly cause knockdowns, like sweeps, throws, many special moves, and in some games, simply getting hit out of the air. There are generally two types of knockdowns, hard knockdowns and soft knockdowns, which describe how long you have to lie on the ground before you can get up and fight again, and what options you may have (if any) while standing up.  In most games, while you are lying on your back, you are invincible to all attacks (except if a game employs OTG moves). The moment when you stand up and become vulnerable again, called the wakeup game or okizeme, is an incredibly important cornerstone of virtually every fighting game. If you are on offense, you may choose to attack with a meaty or execute some planned mixup or set play. If you are rising from the knockdown, you usually should try to block, but you may also choose to reversal to escape, or try to abare your way out. Knockdowns can lead to huge swings in the match and learning to maximize your advantage in these situations and play the mind games well will earn you lots of wins."
K,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=K,Kill Confirm,"A series of attacks that leads to a character with high damage being KOed. Usually the combo will start with a pretty safe move, and if that move hits, you move into an automatic sequence that leads to death; in many ways, this is a Smash Bros. hit confirm, but specifically planned for situations involving high percentage characters.  Note that directional influence can sometimes make these kill confirms harder, and they can be character specific as well, due to the multitude of different weights and falling speeds Smash characters have. Examples in Melee include Captain Falcon's neutral air or throw to his devastating forward air knee attack, or Fox's up throw to up-air on floaty characters."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,LCQ,"A last-minute tournament held at the venue of a big invitational event, where the winner gets a spot in the main tournament. Stands for Last Chance Qualifier. These LCQs are not needed for events where anyone can sign up (including mainstays like EVO), but you'll often find them happening on the day before the year-end finals for certain events like the Capcom Pro Tour or the Tekken World Tour. It's the last opportunity for people who didn't qualify for the event throughout the year, and it's a giant bloodbath of high-stakes matches for the final spot."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,Launcher,"A move that launches the opponent high into the air, usually for more combo opportunities. Most modern fighting games have moves that launch the opponent and allow for some type of combo extension. For example, the Tekken series uses launchers as a staple combo mechanic that most characters frequently use; having a fast or safe launcher in Tekken can be the sign of a strong character. Marvel vs. Capcom 3 cuts directly to the chase and simply has a universal button called ""launcher"" that can start all sorts of fancy air combos."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,Ladder Combo,"A Super Smash Bros. combo that slowly raises your opponent upwards, often by repeated use of up-airs and strategically landing on platforms in order to get more height. The hope is that you can eventually kill them by hitting the upper blast zone. Ladder combos go back to Captain Falcon in the original Smash 64 title, and are still prominently used in modern games like Smash 4 and Smash Ultimate where they can lead to KOs at frighteningly low percents. Aesthetically they're pretty similar to a staircase combo."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,Lariat,"A style of move named after a prominent wrestling technique, often given to grapplers. There are two types of lariats in fighting games. The first is when your opponent spins in circles with both arms extended, often seen with Zangief (Street Fighter) and Haggar (Marvel vs. Capcom 3). These moves are often projectile invincible at the very least, and in some cases, even fully invincible, but your character is mostly planted in place while spinning.  The second type of lariat is a move that causes a character to run forward, one arm extended, ready to give a clothesline when they reach their opponent. These forward-advancing moves are often strong combo finishers or may even be a scary approach tool, depending on the game. You'll see examples of this with Hugo (Street Fighter), Bardock (Dragon Ball FighterZ), and Ladiva (Granblue Fantasy Versus)."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,L-Cancel,"A technique specific to Smash Bros. 64 and Melee that let you reduce the recovery when you land during an aerial attack. By pressing L (or Z) a few frames before you hit the ground, you will cut down the normal landing recovery significantly, letting you start your next attack much more quickly. Virtually every aerial attack in these games is L-canceled by good tournament players (usually as part of a SHFFL). Smash games after Melee do not have L-canceling, instead opting to rely more heavily on auto-canceling."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,Layered Mixup,"A mixup that has more mixups behind it if you manage to successfully block the first one. As you fight stronger players, they will have better defense, so you'll need some backup plans once your first attempt to hit them doesn't work. Multi-way, layered mixups are commonplace in the Versus games, which is why basically nobody manages to escape when Zero's got them cornered."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,Ledge Trump,"Grabbing the edge while another character is holding it, which lets you grab it from under them and forces them into the air. Ledge trumping is only present in later Super Smash Bros. titles like Smash 4 and Smash Ultimate, and is a replacement for the edge hog mechanic of earlier Smash games. Maybe Nintendo wanted to give recovering players an easier time returning to the stage, but ledge trumping still allows edgeguarding tricks, since you can hit players after they float off the edge."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,Launch,"Hitting an opponent who is on the ground high into the air. You might chase after them into the air to perform an air combo, or you might stay on the ground and juggle them for more damage. In either case, you probably used a launcher to start the whole thing."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,Lab,"The training room. It's here where you'll practice your combos, learn how your moves work, and try to create strategies for how to play against certain characters. You'll hear people say things like ""I have to lab that later"" when they get hit by a strong move or mixup and they need to figure out what to do about it. Not everyone is a ""lab monster"" and loves to spend dozens of hours in training mode, but every player should at least know their way around it so they can practice the basics of the game."
L,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=L,Last Arc,"The granddaddy of all supers in Melty Blood. The primary way you'll be landing this is by first entering Blood Heat and then shielding an attack (in MB: AACC, you must use EX shield). Your Last Arc will automatically launch and is guaranteed to punish your opponent for 50% damage or more. In MB: Type Lumina, you can also manually activate your Last Arc at any point by spending 4 bars of super meter and pressing A+B+C+D at the same time. You can't cancel attacks into this move though, so you'll have to find a way to land it raw."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Major Counter,"What Virtua Fighter calls its counter hits. You can counter hit in the ""standard"" way, by hitting an attack during its startup, or also by hitting players trying to Defensive Move, hitting a whiffed reversal (the catch counter variety), or a few other ways. Major counters earn a percentage damage increase which scales higher if you picked a high-damage attack (the ""Counter!"" notification will be yellow or red in VF5US, depending on the damage), so big swings and gutsy reads are greatly rewarded! If you're curious about ""minor counters"" (colored blue in VF5US), that's what VF uses when you punish something."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Magic Series,"Canceling normals into each other in ascending order (from light to medium to heavy). The odd Street Fighter title will have this as a universal system feature, like Street Fighter Alpha 1 and Street Fighter x Tekken (also called ""Boost Chains"" there), but it's particularly prevalent in Marvel vs. Capcom, where comboing light, to medium, to heavy shows up very often in pretty much every character's BnB combo.  Like most terms in fighting games, there are multiple ways to refer to the same mechanic, depending on the game. Guilty Gear fans will often call this a Gatling, for instance, and you may even hear generic words like target combo, chain, or string used. Trying to keep all of it straight is difficult, but in practice they're all somewhat interchangeable."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Magic 4,"When a character's basic 4 attack causes a launch when it counter hits. Not every Tekken character has a magic 4 â€” for some characters, pressing 4, even on counter hit, won't cause a launch or anything special to happen. And not all magic 4s are made equally, since some characters get a fat combo when it hits, while others don't get much. But when your character has a fast 4 that you can easily fish with, you have the beginning of a useful strategy that even beginners can work with."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Macro,"Assigning a single button to act as pressing multiple buttons. For example, if you have a hard time pressing all three punch buttons in a Street Fighter game, you can assign a spare button to be a 3 punch macro, making it a lot easier to do EX moves or similar attacks. Most games will let you macro several common multi-button commands, like throw, in your controller settings.  Note that ""macro"" can also mean a long series of pre-programmed inputs automatically played by the computer. With special software, you could program a macro to do a complicated combo that will never fail, and then just press one button to watch it all happen. Using macros in this sense is extremely illegal in tournaments, and I'd better not catch you doing it online either. The general rule is to stick to what the in-game controller options allow."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Main,"The character you're the best with and play the most. Sometimes you might be forced to switch off this character if they have a bad matchup, but it's the character you'll hope to ride with most of the way in a tournament. People switch mains all the time as the game's meta changes, or as new patches come out that nerf or buff your favorite move. If you never switch mains, maybe you're a character loyalist."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Magic Number,"A specific frame advantage number that allows you to divide all moves in a game into one of two categories. For example, if the fastest common attack in a game is 3 frames, this means that all moves that are -2 on block or better are safe (not counting the rare exception). You might say that ""-2 is the magic number"". It means that if you want to lump moves broadly into ""safe"" (-2 or better) or ""unsafe"" (worse than -2) categories, all you care about is what side of this magic number it falls on.  Each game has different magic numbers depending on their frame data and how the mechanics operate. For example, 10 is a magic number in Tekken (because the jab starts up in 10 frames, so you'll be looking for gaps of 10 frames or more in your opponent's pressure), and +6 is a magic number in Virtua Fighter (since that is when nitaku situations start to work due to the startup of throws and attacks)."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Magic Pixel,"A term used to describe an opponent who has no visible health remaining on their health bar, but are somehow still alive and fighting. It's normally only a big deal if someone is making a huge, unlikely comeback with no life remaining. Especially in games with chip damage, these usually end up being pretty exciting."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Marvel Second,"The length of an in-game second in a Marvel vs. Capcom game. These seconds are longer than one real-life second, so usually you'll joke about how a long combo ""took 10 Marvel seconds"", implying that it was actually an eternity. The length of a Marvel second can also make close matches near time out extra tense, since nobody is really sure when the last second will tick off the clock.  As a side project, I did a fun experiment measuring how long in-game seconds are in various fighting games. So if you want to see the actual length of a Marvel second, feel free to check out the results."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Magnet Hands,"Grabbing the ledge from very far away. Each character and recovery move has a different hitbox which indicates how they can grab the edge, and in some games like Smash 4 and Smash Ultimate, these hitboxes can be so large that you'll kinda zip to the ledge seemingly from a different area code. I wish you the best of luck trying to stop these recoveries."
M,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=M,Manual,"A normal attack during a Killer Instinct combo that skips the regular cancel window for an auto-double. Instead of canceling your opener or linker into one of these two-hit auto-doubles, you instead wait longer until your character returns to neutral and perform a link.  Manuals are a relatively advanced part of the KI combo system and not needed to enjoy the game, but they do add some spice and depth to the game. Manuals are much harder to combo break due to smaller breaker windows, and the delayed timing is really good at causing lockouts. You can usually identify manuals because they will hit once (and a bit later), instead of auto-doubles which hit twice (and a bit earlier)."
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Neo Max,"A super in King of Fighters XIII that costs 3 bars to use (as well as all of your Drive Gauge). Depending on the situation, you can cancel regular special moves or supers (in KoF games, they're often called Desperation moves) into a Neo Max attack; when you do this, it's called a ""Max Cancel"".  Throughout the years, King of Fighters' level 3 supers have had many different names, from ""Dream Canceling"" into a ""Super Special Leader Move"", to ""Climax Canceling"" into a ""Climax Super Special Move"". The particulars of how you can use them in each game differ slightly, but the overall idea is the same; spend 3 bars to do a ton of damage, often by canceling other attacks into it. Like all fighting games, they try to throw as many variations on the term as possible at you, just to see if you can keep up."
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Nitaku,"A mixup in Virtua Fighter where the offensive player is at strong frame advantage and can primarily choose between two options (a common combination being a fast mid or a throw), each of which requires a different defensive action to avoid taking damage. Nitaku is Japanese for ""2 choices"", indicating the binary 50/50 nature the defender finds himself in. You might also hear this called Forced Choice, or 2AFC (2-Alternate Forced Choice).  Due to the wealth of defensive options in Virtua Fighter (including jumping, crouching, backdashing, using Defensive Move, and many more), each offensive action usually has multiple ways to defend. However, if you can generate enough plus frames (in VF5, +6 or higher is the magic number), you can eliminate a lot of these defensive choices. To take the mid-or-throw example, a defender facing a nitaku would be left with a more or less binary guess; block the mid (and lose to throw), or try and attack so the throw doesn't work (and get counter hit by the mid); picking any other defensive choice is very likely to lose to both offensive options. The guess is heavily in the offense's favor, leading to big reward if they are correct.  Sometimes you'll hear ""reverse nitaku"", which is the same situation but talking about it from the defender's point of view. That is, rather than say ""you can attack or throw"", reverse nitaku suggests ""the defender can block or attack"". More advanced situations can crop up that branch into three options. You might have guessed this is called ""santaku"" for ""3 choices""."
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Nerf,"When the developers make a character worse. They might adjust the character's health, make moves slower or do less damage, remove certain combos from being possible, or any number of other things. Some people don't like when characters get nerfed and would prefer the weaker characters get buffed to match, but sometimes characters are too powerful for the game's own good and need to be toned down a bit. Nerfs don't always feel great, but they are often needed."
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Netcode,"Describes the exact method a fighting game uses to implement online play. There are two primary methods used for fighting games, delay-based netcode and rollback netcode. In short, delay-based is slightly easier to implement, but does not feel good in practice, while rollback is more work for the developers, but allows for online play that feels very close to offline. For an extremely thorough breakdown and discussion of these two netcode methods, you're best off reading this article on netcode."
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Ninja,"A slang term used to refer to any of the male Mortal Kombat characters that dress up in ninja garb of a solid color. This includes Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Ermac, Smoke, and others across the franchise. While it's not really accurate to call it a gameplay archetype like the shoto or the Mishima, they do often share hurtbox similarities which means certain combo paths tend to work on all male ninjas equally well."
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Normal,"A basic attack usually activated by a single button press. In most fighting games, you will have different normals if you are standing on the ground, holding down to crouch, or jumping, and some characters may have special attacks, called command normals, if you hold a direction while pressing a button. Some fighting games also have different normals depending on how close you are standing to your opponent. Normals aren't nearly as flashy as special moves. but they are extremely important, and will often form the backbone of your strategy. Don't overlook them!"
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Negative Penalty,"A mechanic in Guilty Gear and BlazBlue that punishes you if you are turtling too much. If you move backwards a lot and refuse to attack for long periods of time, the game will first give you a Negative Warning, and then if you don't start moving forward and attacking, it will actually inflict the Penalty by resetting your Tension Gauge or Barrier Gauge to 0, depending on the game. Negative Penalty tries to force its players to play offense much more than runaway, but in practice the penalty doesn't happen too often and the degree to which it actually prevents defensive playstyles is debatable."
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Notation,"A common language used to refer to directions and attacks so it's easier to talk about fighting games. I'll use this glossary entry to outline a few of the familiar notation styles that every player should know.  Attacks: You shouldn't use the names of your console's buttons (like X or Square) to talk about attacks, since this is not universal. Instead, use abbreviations for the moves themselves. A 6-button fighter will use LP, MP, HP for punches, and LK, MK, HK for kicks. Anime games might use ABC or LMH for light, medium, and heavy attacks, as well as a ""unique"" attack button like S or D. Tekken and Mortal Kombat use numbers for their attacks, specifically 1 and 2 for punches and 3 and 4 for kicks.  Directions: Many games use one lowercase letter for each cardinal direction: d (down), u (up), f (forward), and b (back). Leaving your stick in a neutral position is ""n"", or some games like Tekken will use a star (â˜…). Note that nobody uses ""left"" or ""right"", but rather terms that are relative to where your opponent is. Diagonals, like down+back, will be ""db"" or ""d/b"". Common special move inputs will also have abbreviations, often with a direction attached: quarter circle (qcf or qcb), half circle (hcf or hcb), and DP (dp or rdp â€” ""reverse DP""). It's also quite common to see numpad notation, which uses numbers instead of letters. It's unfortunate that sometimes numbers will mean a direction and sometimes they will mean an attack, but like most confusing things in fighting games, you'll get used to the context over time.  Modifiers: Here are some common ways attacks can be modified. Talk about close and far normals with ""cl"" and ""f"" (for example, cl.HP). Talk about standing and crouching normals with ""s""/""st"" and ""cr"" (for example, cr.HP). If you see ""c"" by itself, this usually means crouching but is ambiguous with ""close"" so we try to avoid it. Talk about jumping attacks with ""j"" (for example, j.HP). Moves that are canceled from a previous attack are separated with ""x"" or ""xx"" (for example, cr.MK xx qcf+HP).  This isn't an exhaustive list, but hopefully it gives you enough to understand most examples!"
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Negative Edge,"The act of releasing a button (instead of pressing it) to perform a special move. You might be surprised to learn that, in pretty much all fighting games, you can throw a fireball by first pressing and holding a punch button by itself, then doing your quarter circle input, and finally releasing the button. This input leniency helps quite a bit to correct for sloppiness on when you press the button during your motions, and you can use negative edge to your advantage with, for example, piano inputs. You might also hear the term used to talk specifically about specials that only activate on a button release, like Cody's Zonk Knuckle."
N,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=N,Neutral,"The stage of a fight where neither player is blocking or getting hit by anything, and you are trying to figure out the best way to start or continue your gameplan. There's also a bit of an implicit assumption that the characters are not point blank from each other, so there is some wiggle room to move around and use a wide assortment of attacks.  Footsies is one important aspect of playing the neutral game, and you'll often hear people talk about ""the neutral"". For example, ""Ryu loses the neutral in that matchup"" means that Ryu has a hard time finding a place on screen where he can start his gameplan without putting himself at risk.  Another common use of ""neutral"" is just any time your character is not blocking, being hit, or knocked down (even if you're point blank). If your opponent attacks you with a string, you might say ""I return to neutral in the middle of that string"". This implies there's a gap, so you have a chance to try evading or attacking (maybe with a dragon punch).  As if that's not enough, neutral can also mean an attack that is neither plus or minus when it's blocked. You'll hear the terms ""0 on block"", ""even on block"", and ""neutral on block"" for this. Both characters will recover at the same time and can attack at the same time, which might lead to trades."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,Okizeme,"The mind games and mixups that occur around attacking and blocking when someone is rising from a knockdown. It is pretty synonymous with the term wakeup, although okizeme tends to refer mostly to the offensive side and which choice of attack they will use, while wakeup refers more to the total situation. But in practice, the terms are often interchanged without much problem. Okizeme is a Japanese word (pronounced oh-kee-zeh-meh) and it's often shortened to ""oki""."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,Offensive Move,"A more aggressive form of sidestepping in Virtua Fighter, primarily used to get positioning at your opponent's side or back. Almost always shortened to ""OM"". To perform this, do a Defensive Move (that is, do a sidestep), then immediately press P+K+G at the same time.  Offensive Moves look very similar to Defensive Moves, but they go a lot farther and your character makes a whooshing sound. Unlike DMs, which are specifically programmed to avoid (most) attacks, an OM is unable to avoid any attacks at all. In other words, you sacrifice the ability to dodge attacks in order to go further with your sidestep, hopefully putting yourself closer to your opponent's side. If you can successfully get to the side, your offensive options are stronger; your attacks gain damage bonuses, can generate more frame advantage, and your opponent's defensive options get worse as well, so a well-timed OM can be worth the risk. You'll also find OMs used in some combos!"
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,Octo Gate,"A plastic device under the joystick of your arcade stick that dictates how it can move. An octo gate is shaped like an octagon, which gives you 8 grooves matching all 8 cardinal directions to nestle your joystick into. If you've played on a Gamecube controller before, you know what an octo gate is. Some people much prefer octo gates to the default square gate you'll find on most arcade sticks, although many others find doing motions like quarter circles on it harder because of the added ridges."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,Offense,"The act of trying to do damage to your opponent, typically from ranges closer than full screen away. Offense is a broad, encompassing term that can include your ability to apply effective mixups, keep good frame advantage during your attacks, and convert openings into high damage. Players and characters with strong offense tend to be able to win rounds quickly when they get into their favorite spot on screen, and will usually make defensive players throw their controller at the nearest wall."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,OCV,"One player beating an entire team in a Pokemon style team tournament without losing. Stands for ""One Character Victory"", since one player playing one character did all the damage. If they are the last player standing for their team and manage this, it's called a reverse OCV. Try not to let this happen to you."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,One Chance Combo,"A Killer Instinct combo that has exactly one breakable attack between its opener and its ender. One chance combos are short, fast, and don't do a lot of damage, but they are good at throwing curveballs at your opponent so they don't know when and how to attempt a combo breaker. They're also useful if you have a good setup ender and want to put your opponent in a lot of gross mixups, since it's the shortest possible combo where the ender can be used."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,On Hit,"How you describe what happens after a move hits. You can talk about general strategy, like ""When you use standing HK, you should cancel into V-Trigger on hit"". Or, very often, you'll use it to talk about frame advantage, like ""Standing HK is +4 on hit"". As you might expect, there is also on block."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,OD,"New York slang that means ""too much"" or ""very powerful"". This is not a term that originated from fighting games, but you'll hear it used when someone loses to something really cool, strong, or ridiculous. Stuff like ""that mixup was OD"" is commonly heard from east coast personalities."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,Offensive Meter,"A meter in Mortal Kombat 11 that can only be used to perform offensive techniques. Like your Defensive Meter, you can hold 2 bars and it gradually refills at a set rate over the course of the match. You commonly use your Offensive Meter to do Meter Burn moves, amplifying your special moves, and a Getup Attack also costs you one Offensive bar. Unlike other fighting games though, your Fatal Blow (which is effectively MK11's super) is not tied to your Offensive Meter, instead separated into another resource."
O,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=O,On Block,"How you describe what happens after a move is blocked. You can talk about general strategy, like ""In Killer Instinct, if you press a button after your opener, on block nothing will come out and you'll be safe"". But by far, the most common use of this phrase is to discuss frame advantage, like ""Crouching MK is -2 on block"", since how safe or unsafe a move is on block is one of the most important considerations for how you'll use that move. Not surprisingly, you can talk about what happens on hit too."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Parry,"A mechanic that lets you brush aside an incoming hit and recover more or less instantly. Usually a successful parry will grant a huge opportunity for a counter attack, even if the move would normally be safe if it was blocked. It's made most famous by the Street Fighter III series of games, and immortalized in gaming history by fighting game legend Daigo Umehara.  Usually you have to take some risk to try a parry. In SFIII, you had to leave block and press forward or down within a tight window around the attack, and in other games like Yatagarasu, parry attempts will have a short animation and leave you open if you didn't catch anything. Similar mechanics in fighters include counters, reflect, and Just Defend."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Phantom Hit,"A strange phenomenon that can occur in Super Smash Bros. where an attack kind of ""half hits"". The move will do either half damage or zero damage (depending on which version of Smash you're playing), you might hear some small half-hearted sound cue, and the attack will not cause any knockback or hitstop. Like the name implies, it's kind of like you were hit by a ghost.  This happens when the hitbox of an attack baaaarely makes contact with an opponent's hurtbox; we're talking like a millimeter of overlap in game units here. The precision is so strict that is more or less impossible to do on purpose, which makes phantom hits almost always an accident and a surprise when they happen. In later versions of Smash Bros., this may also be called a Glancing Blow."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Paint the Fence,"The name of a specific M. Bison combo in Capcom vs. SNK 2. Bison would activate A-Groove, the game's custom combo mode, and quickly take you to the corner before performing looped Psycho Vanish special moves until your health bar just melts. The reason for the combo's name becomes pretty apparent once you see a video of it in action, which I've conveniently provided for you below."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Passing Link,"Canceling normals into each other in the Under Night series. These cancels can be extremely freeform, as long as you don't use the same normal more than once in the sequence. You can go from standing to crouching, and unlike Gatlings from Guilty Gear, you can even go in descending order of strength if you want (often called Reverse Beat). Whenever you press a normal in UNI, you're pretty likely to use this system in some way."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Pandora,"A comeback mechanic in Street Fighter x Tekken where you could sacrifice the character currently on screen to bring in your reserve character. You get a 30% damage boost and your super meter maxes out, but you have 10 seconds to kill your opponent, or you instantly lose the round.  Pandora is pretty weak as far as comeback mechanics go. Activating it raw is more or less suicide, as the opponent just has to run away for 10 seconds (which is relatively easy in SFxT already), and your cinematic supers do not freeze this 10 second timer, so you'd have to avoid using super entirely if your character had a long cutscene. It was really only useful in incredibly situational combos, where you wouldn't kill them normally but the 30% damage boost would be enough. You'd better be right on your on-the-spot damage calculation though; if you're wrong, you lose."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Perfect Shield,"Pressing shield a few frames before a Smash Bros. attack hits you. In Melee, you'll hear this called a ""Powershield"". While you'll still suffer all the normal shield stun of the attack, you'll be granted the ability to cancel the mandatory 15 frame animation that happens when you release the shield button into an immediate attack. It typically means you'll be able to attack quicker and with more options while you opponent is still recovering. If you perfect shielded a projectile, you'll also reflect it back at your opponent! Overall, it's pretty analogous to a parry in a traditional fighter.  In Smash Ultimate, the mechanic works a bit differently; rather than pressing shield, you instead try to release an already-held shield right when the attack hits you. There will be a big flash around your character and you'll strike a little pose, although you will still be able to attack faster than you normally would if you just did a normal shield."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Pad,"A console controller. People might say ""I play on pad"" to indicate they use a PlayStation or Xbox controller instead of an arcade stick or other device like a Hitbox."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Perfect,"Winning without taking any damage at all. In some games, winning with a perfect is really hard, since rounds are long and it's hard to avoid taking chip damage, whereas some other games are built to steamroll opponents quickly, making perfects much more common. You might hear this called ""7 golden letters"", since a surprising amount of fighting games use gold fonts."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Piano,"Pressing multiple different buttons in a row in rapid succession, often by ""drumming"" or ""sliding"" your fingers across the buttons of an arcade stick. It looks a bit like double tapping, except none of the buttons are the same and, generally, you're planning to hit all three punches or all three kicks in ascending or descending order.  You can use this technique to input special moves with rapid fire commands, like Honda's Hundred Hand Slap, or use it to get multiple chances for a super move to come out. This is particularly common in SFIII: 3rd Strike, a game where several characters regularly use tight links to combo into super. In these cases, using a piano input will try to execute the super on several consecutive frames and really increases the chances that you'll get the combo to work."
P,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=P,Party Starter,"A specific move a character wants to land that lets them start scary offensive pressure or a nasty vortex. It might be something as innocent as a sweep or a throw, where that specific knockdown gives the character a whole bunch of scary mixups.  Usually, people will try to fish for this move, since the reward for hitting it is just so incredibly high. Most snowball characters will have a party starter that you want to avoid at all costs. You don't want to let them nudge that snowball over the cliff."
Q,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Q,Quick Step,"A movement option starting in Soulcalibur V that lets you quickly dodge a vertical attack by pressing up or down twice in a row. Unlike 8 Way Run, the standard way of moving in the SC series, this lets you do what is basically a Tekken sidestep, a quick burst of speed in a direction to dodge an attack. It only works in the up or down directions though, so you can't do stuff like Tekken's Korean backdash to put horizontal space between you and your opponent."
Q,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Q,Quick Rise,"The act of rising off your back quickly when you first hit the ground during a soft knockdown. In most games, you can press a button or the down direction right when your back makes contact with the ground to do this. You might also hear this called a tech."
Q,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Q,Quarter Circle,"A motion used to input many common special moves that starts at down and moves in a circular motion, ending at left or right. The version towards your opponent is down, down-forward, forward, or 236 in numpad notation. It's commonly abbreviated QCF for ""quarter circle forward"", or maybe just called ""fireball"", since the vast majority of fireballs use this command. Similarly, down, down-back, back, or 214, is called QCB for ""quarter circle back"", and commonly referred to as the ""tatsu"" input, since it matches Ryu's Tatsumaki special move."
Q,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Q,Quick Roman Cancel,"Doing a Guilty Gear Strive Roman Cancel, and then immediately canceling the RC with an attack. The attack can be a normal (ground or air) or a special move, and it works no matter the color of your RC (except the defensive yellow version), and whether you do the drift version or not. In fact, doing the fast version of Drift RC from the air can send you flying with crazy momentum.  The execution for Quick RC is a little tricky, but it cancels the RC animation almost as soon as it starts, which lets you really surprise your opponent with a mixup. It's particularly good if you cancel the RC with a command throw, since most defenders will instinctively try to block when they see a Roman Cancel happen. This mechanic might be called ""Fast Roman Cancel"" by some players, but FRC is a technique in past Guilty Gears, so abbreviating it to QRC is a bit clearer."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Ranbat,"A common abbreviation for ""ranking battle"", which is a series of tournaments where the players earn points for how they place. At the end of the ranbat schedule, the player with the most cumulative points will be declared the winner. Ranbats are almost always local to a city or region, and are a good excuse for playing games with your friends over the course of a couple months."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Random,"Acting extremely unpredictably and seemingly without a coherent strategy. Calling someone random usually has a tinge of salt behind it, because when it works, it can be pretty frustrating. The world's best players need to throw a bit of randomness into their gameplans to keep opponents off-guard, but don't go too wild or you'll just lose for no reason.  Random can also refer to picking your character using the Random Select feature on the character select screen. In theory you should have an equal chance to play anyone in the game, but in reality you'll get yet another character you don't know how to play for the seventh time in a row."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Raging Demon,"An iconic super for Akuma (and related ""Evil"" characters) in many Street Fighter titles. Akuma travels forward and grabs you, the screen goes dark, and after some rapid-fire hits in the darkness, you appear knocked out on the ground. Akuma then poses with his back to the camera.  The input for this move is bizarre and unique: LP LP forward LK HP. Because you must whiff normal attacks if you wanted to perform this in neutral, good players will often hide the inputs while their character is performing another move, then immediately launch the Demon when the move is complete (or, perhaps, as a kara cancel). It's a scary, high damage attack, especially when given to a high mobility character like Akuma, and it'll often get you when you least expect it."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Rage Art,"A powerful attack introduced in Tekken 7 that is available only when your character is in rage. These are effectively Tekken's supers; your character will freeze the screen and launch an attack that has armor. If the attack hits, you'll start a cinematic where you do a lot of damage. Afterwards, like Rage Drives, you'll be taken out of rage and be unable to use its benefits until the next round. Rage Arts are effective as last-resort attacks when you need to make a big comeback, or as combo finishers after a juggle to close out a round."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Rage Explosion,"A powerful state you can enter in Samurai Shodown that acts as a more powerful version of Max Rage. By pressing A+B+C, you stop the timer and invert the colors on the stage. Your attacks do even more damage than during Max Rage, and in addition to the Weapon Flipping Technique, you'll get access to a new type of super attack called Issen. You can even enter Rage Explosion while you are being hit, giving you access to a Guilty Gear-style Burst mechanic!   The drawback is severe, though. You consume your entire Rage meter, which means when you leave Rage Explosion, whether its time runs out or you land your WFT or Issen, you won't have access to Max Rage for the rest of the match. Be careful about using it too early in the match, or your opponent will be able to fight without fear of your comeback mechanic coming to the rescue."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Rage Drive,"A special, powerful attack introduced in Tekken 7 that is available only when your character is in rage. Your character will flash blue and suddenly launch a strong attack; each character has a unique Rage Drive but they are commonly safe moves that can extend an existing combo or cause a launch. They're kind of similar to one-time-use EX moves. Once you use the attack, you will be taken out of rage and will no longer get the passive damage boost or be able to use your Rage Drive or Rage Art again until the next round."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Range,"A general term to describe how far away the two fighters are, or to talk about a location on the screen. If someone makes an attack whiff, you might say ""they were just out of range"", or if they find a way to make an attack connect just at its tip, you might say ""wow, nice range on that poke"". If you are standing at a distance where a lot of your moves are effective, you'd be ""standing at a good range"".  You can talk about specific points on the screen by using terms like ""close range"" (from point blank to a step or two back), ""mid range"" (somewhere around 1/3 to 2/3 screen away), or ""long range"" (3/4 of the screen away or further). If someone talks about ""ranged fighting"" in the long-distance sense, they're usually talking about zoning. There's lots of uses for this term, but most of them should make reasonable English sense."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Ranbu,"A style of super where your character rushes at the opponent in a straight line and then starts rapidly punching them in place before launching them away. It's most common in the King of Fighters series, specifically Ryo's ""Ryuko Ranbu"" super where the term gets its name."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Randall,"The nickname for the cloud platform which cycles in and out of the Yoshi's Story stage in Smash Bros. Melee and Ultimate. In Melee, this platform rotates on a 20 second timer, always appearing from inside the stage when the final digit in the round timer reads ""4"" (more specifically, it appears at :44, :24, and :04 on the left side of the stage, and :34, :14, and :54 on the right). Because of its predictability, good Smash players will use it as part of their recovery game in clever and creative ways. Why is it called Randall? Sometimes, random forum posts just gain cult status."
R,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=R,Rage,"A comeback mechanic in recent Tekken titles that increases your damage when you are about to be KOed. For Tekken 7, you get a small damage boost when you are under 20% life left, as well as access to your character's Rage Drive and Rage Art abilities. You'll know you're in rage if your health bar is flashing red.  Rage is also a mechanic in recent Super Smash Bros. games. As you accumulate more damage (up to a maximum of 150%), your character's attacks will launch the opponent farther (up to a maximum of 1.1x the distance), although the damage itself does not get a boost. Characters start to smoke after taking 100% damage to remind you that they're becoming a bigger KO threat."
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Save That Shit for Nationals,"A phrase that advises players to keep newly found strategies to themselves since it can give them a competitive edge, especially if you surprise everyone with it for the first time at an important tournament. Commonly abbreviated to STSFN. This is a pretty old-school adage, long before Twitter or Youtube were used to share tech easily with everyone in the entire world instantly. Nowadays, typically the communities that share everything they know as soon as they find it end up being the strongest, since it's the fastest way to make everyone better."
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Screen Freeze,"The period directly after a super (or certain other powerful techniques) where the game pauses for dramatic effect. Usually the screen gets darker, the camera angle might change, and the character does some special pose. The in-game action stops during this time, and depending on the game, you might be able to use what you see during a screen freeze to your advantage after it's over. They aren't always just for show!"
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Sabaki,"An attack in many 3D games, including Virtua Fighter and Tekken, that will automatically parry certain attacks briefly during their startup. In Tekken, the moves they are allowed to parry are almost always limited to fast punches that hit high, like your jab, while in Virtua Fighter, different sabakis are designed to work against highs, mids, lows, and ""styles"" of attacks, like elbows or kicks.  The attack doesn't need to parry anything to work, but it will have the added property of blowing through certain moves in case the opponent was getting antsy and tried to attack. In that sense, it's really comparable to armor in a 2D game, but kinda ""attack-specific"" armor. Similar to the sabaki is the inashi and the reversal (no, not that reversal, the other one)."
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Salt,"Intense frustration, typically after losing a game. Fighting game salt is quite pronounced, since its nature as a 1v1 game means you have no one to blame for your loss than yourself. Of course, this doesn't stop most players from blaming the game, their opponent, or their dog for losing anyway."
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Sako Combo,"An advanced, high execution combo popularized by Japanese fighting game player sakonoko. There have been many ""Sako combos"" across many different games, but the main thing they have in common is Sako found them via extensive labbing, and they're often so difficult to perform consistently that Sako is the first one to prove they are viable in real matches.  The first Sako combo was probably an infinite combo for Bulleta in Vampire Savior, an incredibly precise looping combo consisting of multiple just frame inputs. Since then, Sako has developed famous combos for Evil Ryu in Street Fighter IV and Menat in Street Fighter V, among many other games."
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Safe Jump,"A very well-timed jump attack on a character who is rising from a knockdown. Your goal is to attack extremely close to when you land so that, if the character performs an invincible reversal attack, you will land and be able to block. The opponent is then forced to block your jumping attack, since reversaling doesn't work, which will give you some nice pressure and hopefully an opening.  A safe jump is an option select; with the same set of inputs, you can both attack your opponent and block if they reversal. Pretty useful! The inner workings of a safe jump rely on how much recovery you have when you land from a jumping attack. In most games, it's pretty small, so as long as you have less recovery than the startup of your opponent's reversal move, you can make it to the ground and block in time. Some games have extremely fast reversal attacks though, so if you try to safe jump those with standard methods, you'll just get smoked. Because your attack has to be so well-timed for this to work, it's really hard to just do a safe jump randomly. That's why most people have setups for them so they work consistently."
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Safe,"A move that, when it hits or is blocked, lets you successfully block (or avoid) any possible retaliation from your opponent. Basically, as long as you make contact with this move, you cannot be punished. Sometimes a move may be safe because your opponent is too far away to do anything, even if the frame data says you can be punished in theory. So while the numbers are most of the story, sometimes good range plays a factor. Safe moves play a hugely important part of the offense in basically every fighting game.  If you want to know the science behind a move being safe, it's a race between the block stun of your move and the recovery of your move. You don't necessarily have to recover before the block stun ends (such a move is not only safe, but plus), you just have to make sure the gulf is smaller than your opponent's fastest move. So, you can be minus and safe, as long as you're not too minus."
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Sandori,"A specific type of cross-up attack in Melty Blood: AACC that defeats the game's cross-up protection. Normally in Melty, you can block both away from your character and in the same direction as the offensive character is facing. That means if you do a ""normal"" Street Fighter-style cross-up, you can block this by holding either direction, making it useless.  To do a sandori, you jump over the opponent, perform a double jump, and then immediately cancel the double jump into a backwards air dash. Double jumping turns the offensive character around; this is the key reason why it beats cross-up protection and forces only one blocking direction to work. Then, quickly air dashing lets you stay very close to the opponent's head, leaving the mixup unreactable. One reliable way to input this (facing right) is 4756; 4 is the first input of the backdash, 7 double jumps (and turns you around), and 6 completes the backdash in your new direction.  Sandori is shorthand for the Japanese pronunciation of ""Thunder Drift"", which is the nickname given to this type of air dash movement thing. Some people think ""sandori"" is Japanese for ""3-way mixup"", but it's not."
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Scramble,"A situation where some unlikely or surprising interactions happen, and both players start to panic a little bit and need to quickly improvise what to do. Scrambles are particularly common in fast-paced games where sloppy play is more likely and new situations that aren't often seen can spring up out of nowhere. Creative players with good game sense will often turn these ""off the book"" interactions into cool combo conversions or will always somehow be able to land the next hit despite the chaos. They're also pretty fun to watch when they happen!"
S,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=S,Sandbagging,"Intentionally playing below your ability, usually to troll your opponent or because you want to try and hit some cool, but impractical move or combo. If you're an experienced player and you're playing against beginners, sometimes it's okay to sandbag to let them get some practice in. But some players really don't like it and would prefer their opponents always try as hard as they can."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,Target Combo,"A character-specific attack that lets a normal cancel into another, different normal. Some target combos go on for longer too, sometimes stringing together 3 or 4 normals into a long attack sequence. It's important to note these are specifically programmed to only certain characters, and often appear in their move lists as a unique ability.  It's pretty similar in concept to a chain, and depending on who you talk to and what game you're playing, that term might be used instead. The term ""target combo"" also tends to only apply to titles like Street Fighter; you'll hear ""string"" used for 3D games, or perhaps game-specific lingo like ""gatling"", to describe a similar concept."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,T.O.P.,"A Garou: Mark of the Wolves system mechanic that makes your character stronger when their health reaches some value. It's an abbreviation of Tactical Offensive Position.  Before the match starts, you get to pick the beginning, middle, or end section of your life bar as the T.O.P. section. When your character reaches this amount of health remaining, they'll get some buffs, like slow health regeneration, added damage, and a new attack. It only lasts while your health is in this region though, so make it count. In some ways, it's similar to Capcom vs. SNK 2's ratio system."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,TAC Infinite,"A bug in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that let players ignore hit stun deterioration after landing a TAC, leading to long infinite combos and plenty of dead characters. Just after Marvel 3 had patched out the DHC glitch, things were looking good until players learned that performing a TAC temporarily turned off hit stun deterioration until you touched the ground. It didn't take long for players to figure out a way to trick the game into thinking they never touched the ground, leading to a combo with no HSD and practical infinites for a large portion of the cast.  I outline the specifics of how this glitch works in my blog post on famous FG bugs, but it was never patched and the final version of UMvC3 still sees it employed regularly at high level play. The one saving grace is that, for some characters, the combo is decently hard, so even if you get it started, not dropping it under pressure is gonna be tough."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,Taco,"A slang term that describes Iori's aerial back+LK attack. In general, you can use this to describe any air attack that has a hitbox well behind the character, such that it can only ever hit as a cross-up, but this specific Iori attack is by far the most common use of the term. It originated from the Spanish word ""tacÃ³n"", referring to the ""heel"" of Iori's foot."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,Taunt Jet Upper,"An extremely difficult but powerful technique for Bryan in the Tekken series. Bryan's taunt contains an unblockable hit which can be canceled into other attacks, including his Jet Upper, a high damage launcher. However, performing the taunt and then correctly inputting the Jet Upper is incredibly precise, composed of multiple sequential just frames. Your reward, though, is the threat of a mid unblockable that leads to tons of damage and has nasty other fakeouts attached to it. It's just really hard to do."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,Tag,"Switching which character you are currently controlling in a team game. Usually you will hold down one of your assist buttons for a little bit, and that character will come flying in from the side and switch positions with who you were controlling. Doing this is often horribly unsafe, but there are moments when it can work, including sometimes during combos. If you want to try and switch out a character that's low on life and about to die, maybe try a safer method like a DHC."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,Team Game,"Any fighting game where you select multiple characters and use them together to win a match. The most common use of the term will involve games where you can switch team members on the fly and use your backup characters as assists, like the Versus series or Dragon Ball FighterZ. You may also hear it used for games where your team members play multiple 1-on-1 fights in a row in isolation, like the King of Fighters series."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,Taunt,"A special technique that causes your character to stop fighting and perform an act of showmanship, often disrespectful. In some rare cases (such as Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike), taunts can have a character-specific in-game effects such as increased attack or defensive power, but for the most part, they exist only to aggravate your opponent... and they do a fantastic job of that."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,Tatsu,"The name of a shoto special move where the character travels forward with their foot extended, usually spinning like a top while doing so. It is sometimes called ""Hurricane Kick"" in English, but many in the community call it ""tatsu"", a shortened version of the Japanese name. Tatsus are often briefly projectile invincible which can help you win fireball wars, and they're often good combo enders too.  You can use the generic term ""tatsu"" to refer to a move in any fighting game where the character leads with their foot, flying forward; bonus points if they're spinning and if the command is mapped to quarter circle back. Also, like the term ""fireball"", you can also just use ""tatsu"" as a shorthand for ""quarter circle back"" itself, if you're trying to describe an input quickly (even if the resulting move is not a spinning kick thing)."
T,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=T,Team Aerial Combo,"A Marvel vs. Capcom 3 mechanic available during any air combo that will launch the opponent in one of three directions, then tag in a teammate to continue the combo. Often abbreviated to ""TAC"". You get to pick the direction you launch (whether up, to the side, or down), and your opponent can counter this and escape the combo entirely if they guess the direction, kind of like a mini combo breaker.  TACs can be useful to bring in a teammate when you are low on life, but in competitive play, players found an exploit and primarily use them to do infinite combos."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Unblockable,"An attack that cannot be blocked. As you probably figured out, trying to block the attack will cause you to get hit instead. While technically all throws are unblockable, the term usually refers to a physical strike or projectile that has this property. Some examples include certain charge moves in the Soul Calibur series, Level 3 Focus Attacks in the Street Fighter IV series, and Sentinel's laser barf in Marvel vs Capcom 2. Usually unblockable attacks are either very slow, or the precursor to a fist coming your way at the arcade.  You'll also use the term to talk about setups that cause a move to hit you both high and low, or left and right, at the same time and bypass your ability to block. These are pretty common in games like SFIII: 3rd Strike, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and older Guilty Gear titles, but more and more modern games are using unblockable protection to try and avoid these situations."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Ukemizeme,"Trying to specifically read which way a defender will rise after being knocked down (their ""ukemi"") and then choosing an appropriate offensive response. Because there are so many ways to get off the ground in Virtua Fighter, you'll have to lab specific ways to deal with each of these wakeup options. This can include using attacks that might cover multiple options at once, or trying to react to your opponent's choice and start offensive pressure that will give them a really hard time.  Ukemizeme is a subset of okizeme. While oki describes ""general"" mind games around how to attack a knocked down opponent, ukemizeme really focuses on the subtleties of when and how you call out your opponent's tech roll direction and timing."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Unblockable Protection,"A game mechanic that some games use to try to prevent certain types of undesired unblockables, most specifically the ones where two different attacks hit you both overhead and low, or both cross-up and not cross-up, on the exact same frame. This particular type of unblockable can be easy to set up in certain team games where you and an assist can attack at the same time. Typically, in situations where the game determines two attacks about to hit you simultaneously, the game will just accept any block input as correct. While this can prevent ""true"" unblockables, you might be left with situations that are still pretty messed up."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Universal Controller Fix,"A software mod for Smash Bros. Melee that adjusts two aspects of Melee's code to work better on all Gamecube controllers. The mod tweaks two specific things: it changes the dashback buffer to work the same as forward dashes (no longer requiring a 1-frame window to do a turn-less back dash), and it makes shield dropping easier when you roll the stick from left or right to down-left or down-right, making it harder to get accidental spot dodges.  The reason this is needed is because all Gamecube controllers are not made equal; small changes in build quality between factories and production year can change how easy it is to perform these incredibly precise Melee techniques. Historically, players have had to buy and test multiple controllers or try finicky hardware mods to use a ""good"" controller. UCF makes all controllers equally able to perform these techniques, and is used at virtually all Melee tournaments today."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Ultimate,"An extra flashy way you can end your Ultra Combo, as long as you have earned a Supreme Victory. Simply press LP and LK together shortly after starting the ultra, and you'll transition to a cinematic finisher. Only 15 of the 29 characters in the 2013 version of KI have an Ultimate Combo."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Umeshoryu,"A psychic shoryuken done at an unexpected time that hits your opponent, made famous by fighting game legend Daigo Umehara. You gotta make sure the shoryu is done pretty much out of nowhere, like while you are applying pressure or while you are jockeying for position during footsies, and it can't be a reaction to something; it has to be done purely on anticipation. Oh, and it has to actually hit. It's not an umeshoryu if it doesn't work.  To be honest, you can apply this ""ume"" prefix to pretty much anything if it comes out of nowhere and looks like a genius move. If nobody has thrown a fireball for 30 seconds, but you somehow just magically jump the instant one is thrown, you might call that an ""umejump""."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Undizzy,"A Skullgirls system that is designed to prevent long, touch of death combos. After a brief opening section of the combo where you are allowed to do what you want, the game will begin to fill a green bar located under your health bar (called the Drama Meter) for each hit in your combo. Once the bar gets full, the opponent can burst for free, ending your combo. The bar goes down slowly when a combo is not happening, so you cannot do long combos and then land a reset to bypass the Undizzy system.  It's the second system in Skullgirls designed to protect against infinite combos, the first being the appropriately-named Infinite Prevention System. While that did a good job preventing true infinites by forcing variation, characters still died to one combo anyway. These two systems put together ensure that combos need to be varied and that they can't be too long. Undizzy was originally a system in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, which prevented certain infinites from going on too long."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Ultra Combo,"A special ender in Killer Instinct that immediately ends the match, as long as the opponent has 15% life or less remaining on their final health bar. Like all enders, you have to do an opener first, although because Ultras are not combo breakable, you can (and should!) do opener-ender as often as possible to finish matches without any break chance. Ultras are extremely important to KI strategy and they're used very often.  Street Fighter IV also has a comeback mechanic with this name. As you take damage over the course of a round, you build your ""Revenge Gauge"", which lets you perform one of two pre-selected Ultra Combos. They are effectively just flashier versions of a super that did a lot of damage. Comboing into them from a Focus Attack Dash Cancel was common for many characters."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Unfly,"A special move in some team games that stops you from Flying and returns you to regular movement. It's usually mapped to the same input as Fly so that input simply turns your flight mode on or off as necessary. Especially in older Marvel vs. Capcom games, the pressure you could generate from repeated Fly and Unfly sequences was pretty ridiculous, and the execution was famously difficult."
U,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=U,Unbreakable,"An attack or combo that can't be combo broken. In Killer Instinct, your first attack in a combo, or any stray hit in neutral, is always unbreakable. And almost always, your combo will be unbreakable up until you use a special move (called an opener), which means you can front-load a lot of damage before the opponent can try to combo break if you want! Most projectiles are also unbreakable, so you'll see some characters like Jago using a bunch of projectiles in combos without any risk.  In order to cash out a combo in KI, you will need to give at least one break chance to your opponent, so unbreakable combos won't be able to touch that juicy white life. If you try, you'll trigger a mistake called opener-ender and that's bad. The Mortal Kombat series has its own rules about which combos can be broken; in a game like MK11, if you keep your opponent on the ground (and do not launch them), the combo will be unbreakable."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,Valle CC,"An unblockable attack in Street Fighter Alpha 2, discovered by and named after American fighting game legend Alex Valle. If you activated your custom combo (CC) mode and noticed your opponent was not crouch blocking during the screen freeze, you could immediately attack them low and they could not block, which could lead to huge damage with your custom combo turned on. For more on this and other famous fighting game bugs, check out my blog post on the topic."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,V-Skill,"A character-specific Street Fighter V technique, activated by pressing medium punch and medium kick together. You can basically think of it like an alternate special move that builds your V-Gauge (used for V-Reversals and V-Trigger) if it connects with your opponent. Each character has two V-Skill options, and they'll pick one on the character select screen to use in the fight."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,Variation,"A system in some Mortal Kombat games that gives multiple ways to play a character. Each variation for a character will have some common moves that are always available, and then add some unique moves you can't find in other variations, such as new attacks, movement options, or changes to the properties of existing moves. There are preset variations built by the developers, and some MK games even let you customize your own variation from a collection of all the character's possible moves."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,V-Trigger,"A central comeback mechanic in Street Fighter V. Your ""V-Gauge"" fills up as you take damage or successfully use your V-Skill, and when it's full, you can activate your V-Trigger, which usually powers up your character in a unique way for a good length of time (or, for some fighters, it is just simply a strong one-time use move with no powerup).  At the character select screen, you can choose between two unique V-Triggers to bring into battle â€” some characters may switch up their V-Trigger depending on the matchup, while others tend to find the most success just sticking with the same one, no matter who they're fighting. V-Triggers are strong tools that can drastically turn the tide of battle, but to use them, you can't spend your gauge on V-Reversals or V-Shifts, so it's a trade-off."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,Vanish,"A technique in Dragon Ball FighterZ where you disappear in place, appear on the other side of your opponent and hit them away. Vanish is performed by pressing M+H and costs 1 bar of super meter. It will wall bounce when used after certain moves, making it a great combo extender, and since it is plus on block, you can cancel attacks into Vanish to try and make yourself safe (but be careful, if done poorly you can be anti-aired). While in Sparking, you can hold the Vanish buttons and not perform the automatic strike after the teleport, which lets you get some extra juice by freestyling mixups and combos."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,V-Reversal,"A defensive mechanic in Street Fighter V that lets you attack while blocking. You consume one stock of your ""V-Gauge"" (which is also shared for use with your V-Trigger), and your character will do an attack which is invincible to all hits but can be thrown. Usually, your character will knock the opponent out of the way, dealing some gray life while you get some breathing space. This gray life isn't ""real"" damage until you land another attack, so you'll have to capitalize on your chance before the life heals a few seconds later.  V-Reversals are one of several different ""attack while blocking"" mechanics found across many games, starting with Street Fighter Alpha's alpha counter. The push and pull between using your V-Gauge for defensive V-Reversals and offensive V-Triggers is one of Street Fighter V's main strategic draws."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,Veil Off,"A technique that powers up your character in Under Night In-Birth, often shortened to VO. You need at least half of your EXS gauge filled, and then you press A+B+C. You will enter an install state where you get a 20% damage boost, and all your super meter drains on a timer. While the timer is draining, your EX moves and Infinite Worth super attacks will cost less meter than normal, allowing for combos that wouldn't usually be possible!   The activation for Veil Off can also be used defensively. It is invincible at the start, so you can use it as a reversal, and you can also do it while blocking as a ""get off me"" move. If your Veil Off hits the opponent, you will GRD break them! But if they block it, you'll be in for a big punish. Activating Veil Off will immediately clear your own GRD break as well, so once you get half super meter, you can spend it to reverse an unfortunate GRD break if you like. There's also a stronger version of this called Crosscast Veil Off."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,V-Shift,"A Street Fighter V mechanic that lets you defensively dodge an attack and follow up with a counter-attack. For the cost of 1 V-Gauge bar (a meter also shared with doing V-Reversals and V-Triggers), pressing MK + HP in neutral will perform a V-Shift. You will emit a blue aura and do an invincible backdash, slowing down time if your opponent happened to attack at the same time.  At the end of the backdash, you can then do an automatic follow-up attack called V-Shift Break, or any attack of your choice, which might punish the opponent based on what you dodged. You get a rebate of one-half of the V-Gauge spent if you successfully dodged an attack too! But if your opponent did not attack, you won't get the slow motion effect, you won't get the V-Gauge rebate, and you'll be punishable. V-Shift was added late into the lifecycle of Street Fighter V and gave some situational ways to dodge and punish some common frame traps and powerful close-range moves."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,V-Shift Break,"An automatic follow-up attack you can perform after you successfully dodge an attack with V-Shift. By pressing MK+HP (again) during the slow-motion dodge animation, your character will lunge forward with a basic punch or kick that keeps your full invincibility from the V-Shift, causes a knockdown and deals some gray life. It's a way for you to get some breathing space if you don't have a good invincible attack to follow up with, like a dragon punch or a super, or you are worried about being out of range of those attacks. It's a slow attack, but fortunately it will be safe if it's blocked."
V,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=V,Vanilla,"The basic, first version of a game. Vanilla Street Fighter IV, for instance, is the initial version that came to consoles in 2009, not any of the updated versions like Super Street Fighter IV. Use it when you want to be clear which version you're talking about. Sentences like ""Sagat was really good in Vanilla"" are fine."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wavebounce,"Doing both a B-Reverse and a Turnaround-B during the same special move. If your eyes rolled back in your head while reading that sentence, you're not alone. Let's break it down a little bit.  B-Reverses let you perform a special move in the opposite direction, while also reversing your momentum. Turnaround-Bs will do a special move in the opposite direction, but not reverse your momentum. The combination of these techniques means your character will reverse their direction, but not the direction they're facing. So, the character is pointing at you, drifting backwards, and then suddenly they're pointing at you, coming forwards while attacking.  To do this, you need to tap away with the analog stick, then do your special move, then tap forward quickly. It's harder than doing either technique individually, and the benefits of the movement aren't quite as nice, so you tend to not see it too much."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Window,"A period of time. It's usually used to describe how much time you have to perform a certain action; for example, ""you have a window of 5 frames to perform a reversal"" or ""after performing a special move, you have a window of 30 frames to Meter Burn it"". It's related in some ways to buffering, but that usually implies a much more technical meaning than window, which can be used really generally if you want."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wong Factor,"A phenomenon that occasionally happens to opponents of legendary fighting game player Justin Wong in big tournament matches. They'll play well for most of the match, and then right when they need to solidify their win, they'll just crumble in the heat of the moment, usually by dropping an easy combo or letting Justin wrestle momentum back for a huge comeback.  Whether it's tournament nerves or just Justin's ability to put a vice-like grip on his opponent's emotions through his gameplay, it seems like many people just can't keep it together when it matters most. Perhaps the original Wong Factor moment was this legendary comeback against IFCYipes at the EVO 2007 Marvel vs. Capcom 2 tournament."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,While Running,"The state you're in while you are running forward. In games like Tekken, certain attacks can only be performed While Running (WR), and there are techniques to go from standing still to performing a WR move very quickly; this is called ""instant While Running"" and abbreviated ""iWR"". You have to be careful of the notation though, since in games like Soulcalibur, WR can mean While Rising, whereas Tekken calls that state ""While Standing"" and abbreviates it WS to try to dodge the confusion."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wobbling,"An infinite combo performed by Ice Climbers in Super Smash Bros. Melee. The lead Ice Climber grabs the opponent and starts pummeling them, while the backup Ice Climber, who has been desynched, attacks in the background in an offset rhythm. Together, the pattern is inescapable and goes on forever, but to prevent running out the clock, most competitions will force the Ice Climbers to kill with a smash attack after enough damage has been dealt.  Named after Texas Smash player Wobbles, wobbling has a contentious history, as most infinite combos do. Some believe it is too much reward for a simple grab and is boring to watch, while others believe it gives the strength needed for an otherwise weak character to compete and is no worse than other guaranteed death sequences in the game. In the end, many tournaments chose to ban wobbling, but not without controversy."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wall Splat,"Attacking someone into a wall; if you use the right move, they will splat against the wall and crumble in front of it, open to more hits. In Tekken, this works against any wall that is not designated to break (most of them will work fine). Ideally, you want to hit them directly backwards into the wall so you don't get a side wall. In Killer Instinct, you can wall splat against the corner of a stage if you use a move marked with the wall splat property. For most characters, that is likely to be their designated wall splat ender."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Weapon Catch,"Trying to catch your opponent's weapon in Samurai Shodown and rip it out of their hands. It's basically the disarmed version of Deflect; it's the same input and it tries to counter the same moves, but if you happen to catch a move while you are disarmed, you will immediately disarm your opponent as well, sending their weapon flying to a random spot on the screen, and knock them down. Fighting without your weapon isn't very fun in SamSho, but at least this high-risk move can make your opponent feel the same pain."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wager,"A system in Injustice that lets you escape a combo once per match, as long as you're on your second health bar. Also called a ""Clash"". Press forward plus the Meter Burn button when you're getting hit to initiate a Wager. Your character will break the combo and initiate a close-range struggle with the opponent. After delivering some witty lines, both players choose how many bars of super meter they'd want to wager (even 0).  After both players have input their choice, the characters push each other apart. If the defender wagered more meter, they will get health back. If the original attacker wagered more, they will deal damage. The amount of health gained/lost depends on how many more bars of meter you wagered than your opponent, up to a maximum of 33% health if you won by a 4 bar margin.  If you start the Wager with more super meter than your opponent, you hold the cards because you can guarantee a win by wagering it all. But your opponent may not wager anything, knowing they will lose, which means... maybe you can get away with wagering less than everything and still win? Should you risk it? These are the types of decisions you'll have to make with this system, but even if you lose the wager, at least you'll always escape the combo, which is the primary goal."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wavedash,"A slang term for a certain type of movement that looks like your character is sliding along the ground. Wavedashes almost always move in discrete, repeated chunks (or ""waves""), hence the name. They usually result from using some way to move forward, canceling that movement option halfway through, then repeating it over and over.  How wavedashes work differ depending on the game. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, you can slide along the ground by jumping and using a low, angular air dodge repeatedly. In Marvel vs. Capcom 3, you can use a forward dash and cancel it by crouching before dashing again (although plink dashing ended up being a superior movement option). In Tekken, Mishimas can repeat a certain special move called a Crouch Dash over and over to skitter across the stage, tracking your character and threatening with many dangerous attacks. The main thing in common is just how the characters look while they're moving."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Whiff,"An attack that neither hits nor is blocked. You swung and you missed entirely. Good players will often punish you for this, but it's not always bad â€” sometimes, whiffing fast attacks can be good for faking people out or controlling space."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wall Jump,"Jumping off a wall. Nothing too surprising here. Some characters in 2D games like Street Fighter's Chun-Li can do this when in the corner to escape it, and it's a common mechanic in platform fighters, especially Rivals of Aether where wall jumping is core to the entire recovery game."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wall,"The edge of the stage in a 3D game like Tekken or Soulcalibur. Not all stages will have walls, and even if they do, not all stages will have walls evenly around the boundary. Being put next to the wall is pretty similar to being put in the corner in a 2D game; your options for movement become more limited, making defense harder, and if you get hit, you risk getting hit into the wall for a bunch of extra damage. Depending on the game, you might be able to hit someone through the wall! This will take you to a new part of the stage and open up a ton of extra damage on your combo."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Waseda Style,"A format used in team tournaments where each team submits a complete player ordering before the match starts. Then, the two first players play against each other â€” the loser is eliminated and the winner goes to the back of his team's queue. The second members of each team will now play each other in the same way, and this continues until one team is completely eliminated.  This is different from the ""winner stays on"" mentality of a Pokemon style team tournament, since no player will play two matches in a row unless they are the last player alive on their team. It also ensures that even if one team wins every match, all the players on both teams will get a chance to play. This format is more common in Japanese tournaments, while Pokemon style tends to be more common in American events."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wall Bounce,"Using a specific move to smack your opponent into the edge of the screen, causing them to bounce off of it back to the middle of the stage. Most team games have moves that will cause a wall bounce (for example, Dragon Ball FighterZ's Vanish), and they act as ways to extend a combo.  In games where wall bounces are frequent, you usually can only wall bounce once per combo, and if you try to do more than one, they'll just fall over instead. When planning or labbing combos, you'll usually think about when and how to ""use"" your wall bounce for the most damage. But the mechanic is not limited only to high-octane team games. Street Fighter, King of Fighters, Guilty Gear and many other games have moves that cause wall bounces."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Waveland,"Doing a wavedash in some way other than immediately after you jump. For example, you could do it after you've performed a jump and have started to descend. You can waveland onto the same surface you jumped from if you want, but it's much more common if you jump to a higher platform (usually directly through it), and then waveland on top of it.  Wavelanding keeps your movement unpredictable and gives you fast access to all sorts of attacks, including aerials if you intentionally slide off the platform. You can also do tricks from the ledge while recovering, such as a ledgedash, using this technique."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Whiff Punish,"A particular kind of punish that will hit an opponent after they have whiffed an attack, and are left recovering in the open. Some whiff punishes are possible on reaction, if the attack has lots of recovery or you have a strong read on when your opponent will try to attack. At other times, if you stand at a good range and use strong pokes, you can whiff punish fast attacks without needing a reaction. Whiff punishing is one aspect of playing footsies; walk closer to your opponent so they think it's fine to attack, then walk backwards and watch them swing and miss like a dummy."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,While Standing,"A move that needs to be input as you are transitioning from a crouching state to a standing state (that is, ""while you are in the process of standing up""). Usually abbreviated to WS, for example ""WS 4"" would mean to press your 4 attack while you are in the WS state. You can do these pretty easily after blocking low; simply release the down direction and attack.  You might also hear ""instant While Standing"" or ""iWS"", which means you do it from an already-standing state by quickly crouching first, then attacking. This state is also called ""While Rising"" a lot of the time (in Soulcalibur, for instance), but if you try to abbreviate it as WR, some people will confuse that with ""While Running"". Terminology sure is fun."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Weapon Flipping Technique,"A super attack in Samurai Shodown available only when you are in Max Rage. Often abbreivated to WFT. On hit, you will leave Max Rage with your Rage meter emptying to 0, and your opponent will get disarmed (a pretty big deal). On whiff or block, you get to keep your Max Rage going and perform more WFTs later, although you might get punished. Instead of randomly throwing it out, try landing a hit confirm, perhaps off a throw."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wine Glass,"A method of holding a ball top joystick on an arcade stick that involves putting the joystick rod between your middle and ring fingers (or maybe ring and pinky), like you were holding a wine glass. Some people keep their palm pointing mostly upwards while playing this way, while others turn their wrist kinda to the side and rest it on the base, while keeping the rod firmly held.  Some people will tell you the wine glass method is the only way to ""properly"" hold a joystick; don't listen to them. Many top tournament players prefer to keep all of their fingers free of ""pinching"" the joystick rod and just push and pull the ball top with their fingers, keeping their wrist rested on arcade stick's flat base. Do what feels most comfortable to you."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wombo Combo,"A famous Smash Bros. Melee combo that you can watch here. The original meaning of ""Wombo Combo"" was simply Fox's Reflector attack (a.k.a. Shine) into an up-smash, but once this video hit the internet, nobody cared about that anymore."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wall of Pain,"A technique in Smash Bros. games (but especially Melee) where Jigglypuff performs several back-air attacks while jumping repeatedly. This will either keep you walled out in neutral, or she can use it as an edge-guard by knocking you continuously farther and farther off the stage until you die. Meanwhile, Jigglypuff's excellent recovery lets her safely come back to the stage."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Winners Bracket,"All the players who have not yet lost in a double elimination tournament, paired off and ready to fight. Lose, and you go down to the Losers Bracket. Try not to lose. You might hear the politically-correct term ""Upper Bracket"" used here sometimes, but it lacks the punch (and clarity) of Winners Bracket."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wall Break,"Punching someone through a wall. In Tekken, this specifically means any of the destructible walls on several of the stages, as long as you stay at the same horizontal level (if you also fall down to a new level, that's called a balcony break). Only certain moves can cause a wall break, but they usually open up new combos as the opponent reels from the massive impact of being sent through a wall.  Guilty Gear Strive brings the concept of a wall break to a 2D game as well. When you have your opponent near the corner, you can use certain attacks multiple times to ""damage"" the corner. Eventually, the opponent will splat painfully against the screen edge, then use any attack to send them through, transitioning to a new stage. You will get a giant bonus that says ""Positive"" when you do this, earning you Tension at a much faster rate for the next several seconds. And some rare attacks (usually supers) can wall break pretty much anywhere on the screen."
W,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=W,Wakeup,"The act of rising from the ground after you've been knocked down. Since you are usually invincible when you are on the ground, there's a specific period of time when you become hittable again; this moment in time and the decisions around it from both players comprise the ""wakeup game"". If your opponent chose to do a reversal attack like a dragon punch, you might say ""man, another wakeup DP from this guy?"" Or, if you press buttons and keep getting counter hit, you might hear ""you gotta stop mashing on wakeup"". The term okizeme is very closely related."
X,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=X,X-Factor,"A mechanic in Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that greatly powers up your characters, allowing for huge damage, incredibly fast movement, and combos that aren't normally possible. You can use X-Factor only once per match and it lasts longer (and is more powerful) if you use it when more of your team has died. It can allow for extremely fast comebacks, even if you only have one character left. Make sure your anchor has powerful uses of X-Factor, or else you'll win fewer games."
X,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=X,X-Ray,"Mortal Kombat X's super move. It costs you all three bars of your super meter, but the attacks are often very fast and have armor, making them powerful offensive tools."
Y,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Y,Yomi Counter,"A mechanic for avoiding throws in Fantasy Strike. Rather than try to throw tech by pressing buttons, instead you're asked to input nothing â€” no directions on your joystick and no button presses at all. If someone tries to throw you in this state, you will do damage by automatically throwing them instead. Like most throw systems, you can use common option selects like delay tech (in this case by alternating between blocking and not blocking) to make it easier to avoid being thrown."
Y,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Y,Yellow Roman Cancel,"A type of Roman cancel in Guilty Gear Xrd and Guilty Gear Strive, commonly abbreviated to YRC. The uses are different in each game.  In Guilty Gear Strive, performing the Roman Cancel input while you are blocking makes your character emit a yellow shockwave, which slows down your opponent briefly before pushing them away. This costs 50% Tension and will grant you a bit of breathing space. It replaces Dead Angle from Guilty Gear Xrd.  In the Guilty Gear Xrd series, Yellow Roman cancels apply to moves that are still in their startup (that is, not able to hit the opponent yet), as long as your opponent is not currently being hit or blocking something. They are the cheapest Roman cancel option, costing only 25% Tension instead of the usual 50%, which makes them similar to older Force Roman Cancels but with easier timing. Try YRCing a projectile and then running up behind it to attack your opponent! You can also press the command for YRC while your character is doing nothing (in GG Strive, this option is colored blue instead). You won't cancel any move, but you'll still get a short screen freeze; use this brief slowdown to see what your opponent is doing and input a guaranteed counterattack."
Y,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Y,Yomi,"To read your opponent's intentions and counter them. Yomi is the Japanese word for ""read"", but unless it's used in the name of a term (like Yomi Counter), it's not commonly heard in regular fighting game parlance. We usually just say something like ""nice read"" or ""he's in my head"" instead."
Z,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Z,Zoning,"The act of using long-range attacks to try and prevent your opponent from coming closer, typically by using long-distance normals, fireballs, and backwards movement. Generally, your goal is to frustrate your opponent into doing something stupid to close the gap, like jump, which is when you use a move like a dragon punch to gently place your fist into their face. Zoning can be seen as a mixture of offense and defense, since you are both trying to damage your opponent while preventing them from getting to a range where they can comfortably begin trying to attack you.  Notorious zoners include Dhalsim from Street Fighter (stretchy arms), Nu from Blazblue (summoning magic sword things), and Morrigan from Marvel vs. Capcom 3 (Soul Fist x infinity). Most new players really hate dealing with zoners, usually expressing their frustration by calling you a fireball spammer and unplugging their console."
Z,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Z,Zoner,"A character whose main gameplan involves zoning their opponent to death. Zoners will have some powerful method of attacking from long range, whether it's a projectile or some far-reaching normals, and they'll often have a strong way to move backwards. Examples include Dhalsim from Street Fighter, Axl from Guilty Gear, and Morrigan from Marvel vs. Capcom 3.  Even though they are stronger from long range, most zoners will not be helpless up close! They can rush you down, at least a little bit, if they're forced to play at close range. But it won't be their first choice, and they'll probably back up as soon as they can."
Z,https://glossary.infil.net/?l=Z,Z Combo,"The technical term given to the system in Dragon Ball FighterZ that allows your character to cancel normals into other normals. There are rules in place about how you can do this, such as not repeating attacks and generally always increasing in strength, but stringing together multiple normals will make up a large portion of DBFZ combos. Most players will not use the official ""Z Combo"" name in regular conversation though, and will just call them much more general terms like a ""string"", a ""chain"", or a ""gatling""."
